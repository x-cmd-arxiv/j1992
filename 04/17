The heavy-light bilinear currently\nused for the determination of the B meson decay constant on the lattice suffers\na substantial one-loop renormalization. In this paper, we compute the one-loop\nrenormalizations of the discretizations in which the heavy and light fields in\nthe bilinear are separated by one lattice spacing, and discuss their\napplication.

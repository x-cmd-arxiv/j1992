We argue that the\ntheory should also describe polymers in an {\\sl isotropic} solvent. The dense\nphase is analyzed in a Bogoliubov-like approximation, which assumes a broken\nsymmetry in the phase of the boson order parameter. We find a stiffening of the\nlongitudinal fluctuations of the nematic field, calculate the density-density\ncorrelation function, and extend the analysis to the case of ferro- and\nelectrorheological fluids. The boson formalism is used to derive a simple\nhydrodynamic theory which is indistinguishable from the corresponding theory of\npolymer nematics in an isotropic solvent at long wavelengths. We also use\nhydrodynamics to discuss the physical meaning of the boson order parameter. A\nrenormalization group treatment in the dilute limit shows that logarithmic\ncorrections to polymer wandering, predicted by de Gennes, are unaffected by\ninterpolymer interactions. A continuously variable Flory exponent appears for\npolymers embedded in a {\\sl two}-dimensional nematic solvent. We include free\npolymer ends and hairpin configurations in the theory and show that hairpins\nare described by an Ising-like symmetry-breaking term in the boson field\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 1992 18:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

For one variable they reduce to linear\nfourth-order equations which are characterized by classical $W$-generators; we\nfind that the instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings are directly\nrelated to the non-vanishing of $w_4$.

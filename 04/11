Broken time reversal symmetry and short ranged spin\ncorrelations lead to $SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons term in Landau-Ginzburg action\nfor SQHE phase. We construct appropriate coherent states for SQHE phase and\nshow the existence of $SU(2)$ valued gauge potential. This potential appears as\na result of ``spin rigidity\" of the ground state against any displacements of\nnodes of wave function from positions of the particles and reflects the\nnontrivial monodromy in the presence of these displacements. We argue that\ntopological structure of $SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons theory unambiguously\ndictates {\\it semion} statistics of spinons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 1992 20:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

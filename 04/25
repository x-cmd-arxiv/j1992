We examine some of the constraints imposed by unitarity. These\ncompletely determine (N,2) amplitudes at tree level in terms of the (N,1)\namplitudes when the plus tachyon momenta take generic values. A surprising\nfeature of the matrix model results is the lack of particle creation branch\ncuts in the higher genus amplitudes. In fact, we show the naive field theory\nlimit of Liouville theory would predict such branch cuts. However, unitarity in\nthe full string theory ensures that such cuts do not appear in genus one (N,1)\namplitudes. We conclude with some comments about the genus one (N,2)\namplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 1992 18:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

However, in systems without such imposed\nrandomness, much faster power law growth has generally been predicted.\nMotivated by the slow dynamics present in glasses, we have been looking for\ncounterexamples, i.e., for models without randomness which nonetheless order\nlogarithmically slowly. Here, we discuss two closely related models for which\nwe have simple physical arguments that such slow growth occurs. The basis of\nthese arguments is the claim that the free energy barriers to domain growth in\nthese models are proportional to L. Thus, the barriers grow as the domains\ncoarsen. We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations, which lend strong\nsupport to our claims of growing barriers and logarithmically slow dynamics.\nFinally, we discuss how quickly the system orders when it is cooled\ncontinuously through the transition (rather than quenched).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1992 16:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

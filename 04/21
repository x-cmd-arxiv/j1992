The\ncalculation, though technically trivial, has important conceptual implications:\n(1) The existence of Hawking radiation from black holes is ultimately dependent\nonly on the fact that massless quanta (and all other forms of matter) couple to\ngravity. (2) The thermal nature of the Hawking spectrum depends only on the\nfact that the number of internal states of a large mass black hole is enormous.\n(3) Remarkably, the resulting formula for the decay rate gives meaningful\nanswers even when extrapolated to low mass black holes. The analysis strongly\nsupports the scenario of complete evaporation as the endpoint of the Hawking\nradiation process (no naked singularity, no stable massive remnant).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1992 20:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The constraints we start with are implemented by the Virasoro\ngenerators depending on a background charge $Q$. Then the solutions to the\nconstraints are given by the theory which has the same field content as the\nDavid-Distler-Kawai theory: it consists of a minimal matter scalar with\nbackground charge $Q$, dressed with an extra `Liouville' scalar. The\nconstruction is based on a generalization of the Kontsevich parametrization of\nthe KP times achieved by introducing into it Miwa parameters which depend on\nthe value of $Q$. Under the thus defined Kontsevich-Miwa transformation, the\nVirasoro constraints are proven to be equivalent to a master equation depending\non the parameter $Q$. The master equation is further identified with a\nnull-vector decoupling equation. We conjecture that $W^{(n)}$ constraints on\nthe KP hierarchy are similarly related to a level-$n$ decoupling equation. We\nalso consider the master equation for the $N$-reduced KP hierarchies. Several\ncomments are made on a possible relation of the generalized master equation to\n{\\it scaled} Kontsevich-type matrix integrals and on the form the equation\ntakes in higher genera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1992 23:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-04"}

A paradigmatic non-gravitational example of such\n``co-winding\" solitons is furnished by Yang-Mills theory defined on $M^4 X\nS^1$.

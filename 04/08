In isolation the latter solitons have infinite energy,\ncorresponding to the presence of a string carrying the non-singlet colour flux\noff to spatial infinity. When $N_c$ solitons of this type are combined, a\nstatic, finite-energy, colour singlet solution is formed, corresponding to a\nbaryon. Similarly, static meson solutions are formed out of a soliton and an\nanti-soliton of different flavours. The stability of the mesons against\nannihilation is ensured by flavour conservation. The static solutions exist\nonly when the fundamental fields of the bosonized Lagrangian belong to\n$U(N_c{\\times}N_f)$ rather than to $SU(N_c) \\times U(N_f)$. Discussion of\nflavour symmetry breaking requires a careful treatment of the normal ordering\nambiguity. Our results can be viewed as a derivation of the constituent quark\nmodel in QCD$_2$, allowing a detailed study of constituent mass generation and\nof the heavy quark symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 1992 16:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

However for a fixed genus we can expand in the\ncosmological constant g for arbitrary values of n, and a simple minded analysis\nof the series yields for n=0,1 and 2 the expected results for the exponent\n$\\gamma_{string}$ with an amazing precision given the small number of terms\nthat we considered. We then proceed to larger values of n. Simple tests of\nuniversality are successfully applied; for instance we obtain the same\nexponents for n=3 or for one Ising model coupled to a one dimensional target\nspace. The calculations are easily extended to states Potts models, through an\nintegration over $q^{n}$ matrices.

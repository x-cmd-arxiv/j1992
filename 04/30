These data are\nbest explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended\nspherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius\nis at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible\norigins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars\nrecoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical\nmodel leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole\nanisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become\nmillisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of\ngamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts\nof gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 1992 16:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 1992 20:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Using weak\ncoupling and large N techniques, we present a variety of models in which this\nconclusion is shown to be false when nonperturbative variations of the scalar\nfield are considered. The heavy fermions contribute nonlocal terms to the\neffective action for light degrees of freedom. This resolves paradoxes about\nanomalous and nonanomalous symmetry violation in these models.

There are at least three\nthousand distinct models in this class. All vacua of this type lead to Euler\nnumbers which lie in the range $-960 \\leq \\chi \\leq 960$. The Euler\ncharacteristics do not pair up completely hence the space of Landau--Ginzburg\nground states is not mirror symmetric even though it exhibits a high degree of\nsymmetry. We discuss in some detail the relation between Landau--Ginzburg\nmodels and Calabi--Yau manifolds and describe a subtlety regarding\nLandau--Ginzburg potentials with an arbitrary number of fields. We also show\nthat the use of topological identities makes it possible to relate\nLandau-Ginzburg theories to types of Calabi-Yau manifolds for which the usual\nLandau-Ginzburg framework does not apply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1992 08:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

A class of potentials is identified\nfor which the spectrum is that of a massless boson and Majorana fermion.

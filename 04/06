The emphasis is on spin dependent\nscattering, but the theory of spin averaged scattering is also discussed. A\ndetailed analysis is given for the case of spin 1/2 targets, with a brief\ndiscussion of higher spin targets at the end. The QCD derivation of the\nCallan-Gross relation, the longitudinal structure function $F_L$, and the\nBjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules is presented. I also discuss the\nWilczek-Wandzura contribution to $g_2$, and why the Gottfried sum rule does not\nhold in QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 1992 21:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Gauge invariance and unitarity are\nachieved through a derivative coupling of the W-Z field to the fermionic\ncurrent; the anomaly gets cancelled in the above infinite fermion mass limit.\nWe show how the problems of renormalizability are evaded at the one-loop level\nby resumming diagrams at the ladder approximation and reshuffling the\nperturbative series, and because the fermionic current is conserved. The\nWess-Zumino field can be \"gauged away\" to become the 3rd polarization of the\nmassive gauge field; the pseudoscalar partner of the Higgs, tightly linked to\nthe W-Z field, behaves like an abelian pion. In particular, no extra scale of\ninteraction has to be introduced, unlike in \"technicolour\" theories. Problems\nconcerning the leptonic sector are only mentionned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 1992 08:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Its regularization reveals that the\nalleged gauge dependence pertains to the residue rather than the pole of the\nfermion propagator, so that in particular the damping constant comes out\ngauge-independent, as it should.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 1992 09:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

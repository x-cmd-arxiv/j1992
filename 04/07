We find two interesting scaling\nlimits and calculate the free energy for both situations. One limit corresponds\nto Dirichlet boundary conditions for the dual graphs and the other corresponds\nto Neumann conditions. We compute the boundary cosmological constant and show\nthat it is of order $1/\\log(\\beta)$. We also briefly discuss a possible analog\nof the Das-Jevicki field for the open string tachyon. (n.b.

This\nparadigm of general relativity as an ``already parametrized theory'' forms the\nbasis for one of the most satisfactory resolutions of the problems of time and\nobservables in classical and quantum gravity. However, despite decades of\neffort, no identification of many-fingered spacetime variables has ever been\nsatisfactorily obtained for vacuum general relativity. We point out that there\nis an obstruction to identifying the constraint surface of general relativity\n(for the case of a closed universe) with that of any parametrized theory.\nTherefore, strictly speaking, general relativity cannot be viewed as a\nparametrized field theory. We discuss implications for the canonical\nquantization program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 1992 20:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

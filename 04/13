We find that the measured critical\nexponents are in reasonable agreement with those from the exact solution of the\nIsing model and with those calculated from KPZ scaling for q=3,4 where no exact\nsolution is available. Using Binder's cumulant we find that the q=10 Potts\nmodel displays a first order phase transition on a dynamical graph, as it does\non a fixed lattice. We also examine the internal geometry of the graphs\ngenerated in the simulation, finding a linear relationship between ring length\nprobabilities and the central charge of the Potts model\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 1992 15:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

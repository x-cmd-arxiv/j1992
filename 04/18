Only\nreferences have been changed.] We describe a technique for constructing the\neffective chiral theory for quenched QCD. The effective theory which results is\na lagrangian one, with a graded symmetry group which mixes Goldstone bosons and\nfermions, and with a definite (though slightly peculiar) set of Feynman rules.\nThe straightforward application of these rules gives automatic cancellation of\ndiagrams which would arise from virtual quark loops. The techniques are used to\ncalculate chiral logarithms in $f_K/f_\\pi$, $m_\\pi$, $m_K$, and the ratio of\n$\\langle{\\bar s}s\\rangle$ to $\\langle{\\bar u}u\\rangle$. The leading\nfinite-volume corrections to these quantities are also computed. Problems for\nfuture study are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 1992 20:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1992 18:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

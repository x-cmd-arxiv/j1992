There are many possible Weierstrass gap sequences at total\ninflection points. Our main results are: Among them (1) There exists a pair\n$(P,\\Gamma )$ such that the gap sequence at $P$ is the minimal (in the sense of\nweight). (2) There exists a pair $(P,\\Gamma )$ such that the gap sequence at\n$P$ is the maximal (resp. up to 1 maximal).

We\nargue that this is not necessarily the case in the supersymmetric standard\nmodel because, apart from B and/or L, there are, above a certain temperature\n$T_{SS}$, two other anomalous U(1) currents. As a consequence, anomalous\nelectroweak effects are only able to partially transform a B+L excess into a\ngeneration of primordial sparticle (e.g. gaugino) density. This relaxes recent\nbounds on B,L-violating non-renormalizable couplings by several orders of\nmagnitude. In particular, dimension-5 couplings inducing neutrino masses may be\n4 orders of magnitude larger than in the non-supersymmetric case, allowing for\nneutrino masses of the order of 10 eV. These values are consistent with a\nMSW+see-saw explanation of the solar-neutrino data and also with possible\nneutrino oscillations measurable at accelerators. Cosmological bounds on other\nrare processes, such as neutron-antineutron oscillations get also relaxed by\nseveral orders of magnitude compared with previous estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 1992 17:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Renormalized\nprimitive divergent amplitudes have the property that their form away from the\noverall coincident point singularity is fully determined by the bare\nLagrangian, and scale dependence is restricted to $\\delta$-functions at the\nsingularity. If gauge fixing could be ignored, one would expect these\namplitudes to be conformal invariant for non-coincident points. We find that\nthe one-loop three-gluon vertex function $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(x,y,z)$ is\nconformal invariant in this sense, if calculated in the background field\nformalism using the Feynman gauge for internal gluons. It is not yet clear why\nthe expected breaking due to gauge fixing is absent. The conformal property\nimplies that the gluon, ghost and quark loop contributions to\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$ are each purely numerical combinations of two universal\nconformal tensors $D_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(x,y,z)$ and $C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(x,y,z)$ whose\nexplicit form is given in the text. Only $D_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$ has an ultraviolet\ndivergence, although $C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$ requires a careful definition to resolve\nthe expected ambiguity of a formally linearly divergent quantity.\nRegularization is straightforward and leads to a renormalized vertex function\nwhich satisfies the required Ward identity, and from which the beta-function is\neasily obtained. Exact conformal invariance is broken in higher-loop orders,\nbut we outline a speculative scenario in which the perturbative structure of\nthe vertex function is determined from a conformal invariant primitive core by\ninterplay of the renormalization group equation and Ward identities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 1992 19:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}

These allow one, in\nprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\nvariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\\dot{G}$\nwhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\none may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\\dot{G}$ today,\nbut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\nto fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\\Omega_0$ from lensing\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 1992 17:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-18"}

By integrating numerical processes at\nall scales of a problem, it seeks to perform various computational tasks at a\ncost that rises as slowly as possible as a function of $n$, the number of\ndegrees of freedom in the problem. Current and potential benefits for lattice\nfield computations are outlined. They include: $O(n)$ solution of Dirac\nequations; just $O(1)$ operations in updating the solution (upon any local\nchange of data, including the gauge field); similar efficiency in gauge fixing\nand updating; $O(1)$ operations in updating the inverse matrix and in\ncalculating the change in the logarithm of its determinant; $O(n)$ operations\nper producing each independent configuration in statistical simulations\n(eliminating CSD), and, more important, effectively just $O(1)$ operations per\neach independent measurement (eliminating the volume factor as well). These\npotential capabilities have been demonstrated on simple model problems.\nExtensions to real life are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1992 08:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

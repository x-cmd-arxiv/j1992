For the two\nstep symmetry breaking chains ,where left-right symmetric gauge groups appear\nat the intermediate scale, we find that parity invariance of the theory at the\nunification scale drastically reduces the GUT threshold effects in some cases.\nIncluding the effects of the intermediate scale thresholds ,we compute the\nuncertainty in the above mass scales and study their implications for proton\nlifetime and neutrino masses. An important outcome of our analysis is that if\nthe currently favored nonadiabatic MSW solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is\naccepted , it will rule out the $SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXU(1)_{B-L}X SU(3)_c$ as an\nintermediate symmetry for SO(10) breaking whereas the intermediate symmetry\n$SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXSU(4)_c$, is quite consistent with it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1992 20:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

For solutions of the exact nonlinear field equations\nof the electroweak theory with lattice periodicity in directions perpendicular\nto the magnetic field, it is proven that, likewise, each lattice cell must\nenclose an integer number of quanta of magnetic flux. Close to the lower\ncritical magnetic field, a perturbative method developed by MacDowell and the\nauthor is used to study properties of the lattice solutions. Analytical\nexpressions for observables are obtained in terms of a complex parameter $\\tau$\nspecifying the lattice and it is shown that the triangular Abrikosov solution\nconstitutes a local minimum of the energy provided $M_H > M_Z$.\n  PACS numbers: 11.15.Kc, 11.15.Ex, 74.60.-w, 05.70.Fh\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1992 14:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

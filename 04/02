We first briefly assess the production cross sections and\nupdate the decay branching fractions for a Higgs boson of intermediate mass,\nwith M_Z < m_H < 2M_W. We then study in detail the possibility of detecting a\nheavy Higgs boson, with m_H > 2M_W, through the production of pairs of weak\nbosons. We quantitatively analyze the sensitivity of the process e^+ e^- --> nu\nnubar W^+ W^- (ZZ) to the presence of a heavy Higgs-boson resonance in the\nStandard Model. We compare this signal to various backgrounds and to the\nsmaller signal from e^+ e^- --> ZH --> mu^+ mu^- W^+ W^- (ZZ), assuming the\nweak-boson pairs to be detected and measured in their dominant hadronic decay\nmodes W^+ W^- (ZZ) --> 4jets. A related Higgs-boson signal in 6-jet final\nstates is also estimated. We show how the main backgrounds from e^+ e^- W^+ W^-\n(ZZ), e nu WZ, and t tbar production can be reduced by suitable acceptance\ncuts. Bremsstrahlung and typical beamstrahlung corrections are calculated.\nThese corrections reduce Higgs-boson production by scattering mechanisms but\nincrease production by annihilation mechanisms; they also smear out some\ndynamical features such as Jacobian peaks in p_T(H). With all these corrections\nincluded, we conclude that it should be possible to detect a heavy Higgs-boson\nsignal in the nu nubar W^+ W^-(ZZ) channels up to mass m_H=350 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 1992 16:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

The model also has a large number of\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, some of which can be light. The top-quark\ncondensate is responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry and gives\nthe top quark a large mass.

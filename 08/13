The analysis reveals that, even in\na Markov limit, which can often be justified, the time dependences and\nnonlinearities can induce new and potentially significant effects, such as\nsystematic and stochastic mass renormalizations and state-dependent ``memory''\nfunctions, aside from the standard ``friction'' of a heuristic Langevin\ndescription. One specific example is discussed in detail, namely the case of an\ninflaton field, characterized by a Landau-Ginsburg potential, that is coupled\nquadratically to a bath of scalar ``radiation.'' The principal conclusion\nderived from this example is that nonlinearities and time-dependent couplings\ndo {\\em not} preclude the possibility of deriving a fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, and do {\\em not} change the form of the late-time steady state\nsolution for the system, but {\\em can} significantly shorten the time scale for\nthe approach towards the steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 1992 06:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

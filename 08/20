This definition may be viewed as a generalization of\nthe definitions of Laksov and St\\\"ohr-Voloch to the Gorenstein case. In the\nsecond section, an example is given to illustrate the definition. This example\nis a plane curve of arithmetic genus 3 in characteristic 2 such that the gap\nsequence at every smooth point (with respect to the dualizing bundle) is 1,2,5\nand there are no smooth Weierstrass points. In the third section, the\nWeierstrass weight of a unibranch singularity (on a not necessarily rational\ncurve) is computed in terms of its semigroup of values. In the final section,\nthe Weierstrass weight of a singularity with precisely two branches (again\nassuming that the characteristic is zero) is computed.\n  AMS Classification: Primary 14H55, Secondary 14H20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 1992 14:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

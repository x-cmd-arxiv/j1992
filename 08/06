At half filling we observe a gradual\ncrossover from a normal Fermi-liquid with a Drude peak at $\\omega=0$ in the\noptical conductivity to an insulator as a function of $U$ for temperatures\nabove the antiferromagnetic phase transition. When doped, the ``insulator''\nbecomes a Fermi-liquid with a corresponding temperature dependence of the\noptical conductivity and resistivity. We find a $T^2$-coefficient in the low\ntemperature resistivity which suggests that the carriers in the system acquire\na considerable mass-enhancement due to the strong local correlations. At high\ntemperatures, a crossover into a semi-metallic regime takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1992 17:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

To relate the physical quantity to Monte Carlo data one has to know\nthe renormalization coefficient, $Z$, between the lattice operators and their\ncontinuum counterparts. We come back to this computation to resolve\ndiscrepancies found in previous calculations. We define and discuss in detail\nthe renormalization procedure that allows the (perturbative) computation of\n$Z$. Comparing the one-loop calculations in the effective Lagrangian approach\nwith the direct two-loop calculation of the two-point $B$-meson correlator in\nthe limit of large $b$-quark mass, we prove that the two schemes give\nconsistent results to order $\\alpha_s$. We show that there is, however, a\nrenormalization prescription ambiguity that can have sizeable numerical\nconsequences. This ambiguity can be resolved in the framework of an $O(a)$\nimproved calculation, and we describe the correct prescription in that case.\nFinally we give the numerical values of $Z$ that correspond to the different\ntypes of lattice approximations discussed in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1992 16:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

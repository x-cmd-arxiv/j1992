In 1983, Alvarez-Gaum\\'e and Witten observed that one can\nsimplify this evaluation by replacing the operators which appear in the\nregulator and in the jacobian by quantum mechanical operators with the same\n(anti)commutation relations. By rewriting this quantum mechanical trace as a\npath integral with periodic boundary conditions for a one-dimensional\nsupersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, they obtained the chiral anomalies for\nspin 1/2 and 3/2 fields and selfdual antisymmetric tensors in d dimensions. In\nthis article, we treat the case of trace anomalies for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 fields\nin a gravitational and Yang-Mills background. We do not introduce a\nsupersymmetric sigma model, but keep the original Dirac matrices $\\g^\\m$ and\ninternal symmetry generators $T^a$ in the path integral. As a result, we get a\nmatrix-valued action. Gauge covariance of the path integral then requires a\ndefinition of the exponential of the action by time-ordering. We exponentiate\nthe factors $\\sqrt g$ in the path integral measure by using vector ghosts in\norder to exhibit the cancellation of the sigma model divergences more clearly.\nWe compute the trace anomalies in d=2 and d=4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 1992 13:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Abstract We present a\nhamiltonian quantization of the $SL(2,R)$ 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory\nwith fractional coupling constant $k=s/r$ on a space manifold with torus\ntopology in the ``constrain-first'' framework. By generalizing the ``Weyl-odd''\nprojection to the fractional charge case, we obtain multi-components\nholomorphic wave functions whose components are the Kac-Wakimoto characters of\nthe modular invariant admissible representations of ${\\hat A}_1$ current\nalgebra with fractional level. The modular representations carried by the\nquantum Hilbert space satisfy both Verlinde's and Vafa's constraints coming\nfrom conformal field theory. They are the ``square-roots'' of the\nrepresentations associated to the conformal $(r,s)$ minimal models. Our results\nimply that Chern-Simons theory with $SO(2,2)$ as gauge group, which describes\n$2+1$-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant, has the modular\nproperties of the Virasoro discrete series. On the way, we show that the\n2-dimensional counterparts of Chern-Simons $SU(2)$ theories with half-integer\ncharge $k=p/2$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1992 13:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

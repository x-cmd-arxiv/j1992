The calculations were performed using the full\npotential linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) to calculate the total\nenergy as a function of strain, after which the data was fit to a polynomial\nfunction of the strain to determine the modulus. A procedure for estimating the\nerrors in this process is also given. The predicted equilibrium lattice\nparameters are slightly smaller than found experimentally, consistent with\nother LDA calculations. The computed elastic moduli are within approximately\n10% of the experimentally measured moduli, provided the calculations are\ncarried out at the experimental lattice constant. The LDA equilibrium shear\nmodulus C11-C12 increases from 59.3 GPa in Al, to 76.0 GPa in Al_7Li, to 106.2\nGPa in Al_3Li. The modulus C_44 increases from 38.4 GPa in Al to 46.1 GPa in\nAl_7Li, then falls to 40.7 GPa in Al_3Li. All of the calculated elastic moduli\nincrease with pressure with the exception of BCC Li, which becomes elastically\nunstable at about 2 GPa, where C_11-C_12 vanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 1992 13:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

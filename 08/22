In an\nattempt to circumvent this problem, we study three scenarios (all with\n$\\Omega=1$) which have more large-scale power and less small-scale power than\nthe CDM model: 1) an admixture of cold and hot dark matter; 2) cold dark matter\nwith a non-scale-invariant, power-law primordial power spectrum; and 3) cold\ndark matter with coupling of dark matter to a long-range vector field. Despite\nthe {reduced} small-scale power, when such models are evolved in the nonlinear\nregime to large amplitude, the velocities on small scales are actually {\\it\nincreased} over CDM with the same value of $\\sigma_8$. This `flip-over', in\ndisagreement with the expectation from linear perturbation theory, arises from\nthe nonlinear coupling of the extra power on large scales with shorter\nwavelengths. However, due to the extra large-scale power, the recent COBE DMR\nresults indicate smaller amplitudes for these models, $\\sigma_8 \\sim 0.5 -\n0.7$, than for CDM (for which $\\sigma_8 \\sim 1.2$). Therefore, when normalized\nto COBE on large scales, such models do lead to reduced velocities on small\nscales and they produce fewer halos compared with CDM. Quantitatively it seems,\nhowever, that models that produce sufficiently low small-scale velocities fail\nto produce an adequate distribution of halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 1992 20:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We present a detailed description of the simplest one dimensional\n{($d$$=$$1$)} model which supports the hypothesis of wide applicability of the\nmean--field approximation for the scalar fields and the existence of critical\nbehaviour in the model when the scalar action is Gaussian. Despite the\nocurrence of various non--trivial types of critical behaviour in the $d=1$\nmodel as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, only the conventional large-$N$ limit is\nrelevant for its {\\it continuum} limit. We also give a mean--field analysis of\nthe $N=2$ model in {\\it any} $d$ and show that a saddle point always exists in\nthe region $m^2>m_{\\rm crit}^2(=d)$. In $d=1$ it exhibits critical behaviour as\n$m^2\\rightarrow m_{\\rm crit}^2$. However when $d$$>$$1$ there is no critical\nbehaviour unless non--Gaussian terms are added to the scalar field action. We\nargue that similar behaviour should occur for any finite $N$ thus providing a\nsimple explanation of a recent result of D. Gross. We show that critical\nbehaviour at $d$$>$$1$ and $m^2>m^2_{\\rm crit}$ can be obtained by adding a\n$logarithmic$ term to the scalar potential. This is equivalent to a local\nmodification of the integration measure in the original Kazakov--Migdal model.\nExperience from previous studies of the Generalized Kontsevich Model implies\nthat, unlike the inclusion of higher powers in the potential, this minor\nmodification should not substantially alter the behaviour of the Gaussian\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 1992 19:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 1992 04:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

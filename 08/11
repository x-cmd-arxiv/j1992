The calculations were performed using an approximate\nsolution to the single-impurity Anderson model, which is the key quantity\nentering the solution of the Hubbard model in this limit. To establish the\nquality of this approximation we compare its results, together with those\nobtained from two other widely used methods, to essentially exact quantum Monte\nCarlo results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 1992 15:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In this\ncase, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss\nof the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its\ngain from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.\nWe claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be\nregarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and\namplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce\nastrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing\nand Doppler effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 1992 09:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

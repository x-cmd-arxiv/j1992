The idea, called\n`extremization', is to minimize $\\int(\\dl S/\\dl A_\\mu)^2$. The method was\nimplemented in an explicitly gauge variant way, however, and gauge dependence\nshowed up in the results.\n  Here we show how extremization can be formulated in a way that preserves\ngauge invariance on the lattice. The method applies to any gauge group and any\nlattice action. The procedure is worked out in detail for the standard\nplaquette action with gauge groups U(1) and SU(N).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 1992 23:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

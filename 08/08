The\nspectroscopy of these systems is essentially identical. Parameterizations of\nthe wave functions are presented which can be used as interpolating fields for\nspectroscopy calculations. The sizes of particles are calculated using these\nparameterized wave functions. The resulting sizes are small, approximately half\nthe sizes of the physical states. The charge radius of the neutron, which\nprovides an indication of the asymmetries between the wave functions of up and\ndown quarks, is calculated. Although the size of the nucleon in these\nsimulations is small, the ratio of the charge radius of the neutron to that of\nthe proton is consistent with the physical value.

We use analogies with experimentally accessible\nphase transitions in liquid crystals, and theoretical investigations of\nsuperconductor phase transitions to argue that, in this range, the critical\nbehavior of a large class of gauge-Higgs-fermion systems changes from 1st to\n2nd-order as a function of Higgs mass.

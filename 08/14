The appropriate\nstochastic quantum Liouville equation is derived. Explicit solutions for the\nphase space quantum distribution function are found for the cases of power law\nand exponential expansions. The expectation values of dynamical variables with\nrespect to these solutions are compared to the corresponding cutoff regularized\nfield theoretic results (we do not restrict ourselves only to $\\VEV{\\F^2}$).\nFair agreement is found provided the coarse-graining scale is kept within\ncertain limits. By focusing on the full phase space distribution function\nrather than a reduced distribution it is shown that the thermodynamic\ninterpretation of the stochastic formalism faces several difficulties (e.g.,\nthere is no fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The coarse-graining does not\nguarantee an automatic classical limit as quantum correlations turn out to be\ncrucial in order to get results consistent with standard quantum field theory.\nTherefore, the method does {\\em not} by itself constitute an explanation of the\nquantum to classical transition in the early Universe. In particular, we argue\nthat the stochastic equations do not lead to decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 1992 19:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

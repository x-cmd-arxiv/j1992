This Letter shows that all such instantons (irrespective of\ntheir interior behaviour) must have the same asymptotic structure as the\nSchwarzschild instanton. Using this, it can be shown that if the Ricci tensor\nof the manifold is non-negative it must be flat. One special case is when the\nRicci tensor vanishes; hence one can conclude that there is no nontrivial\nvacuum gravitational instanton. This result has uses both in quantum and\nclassical gravity. It places a significant restriction on the instabilities of\nhot flat space. It also can be used to show that any static vacuum Lorentzian\nKaluza-Klein solution is flat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 1992 11:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The conditions are posed directly in\nterms of physical variables and show that what one needs is a relatively large\namount of excess matter confined to a small volume. The expansion of the\nuniverse and an outward flow of matter oppose the formation of trapped\nsurfaces; an inward flow of matter helps. The model can be regarded as a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^\\i tre-Walker cosmology with localized spherical\ninhomogeneities.

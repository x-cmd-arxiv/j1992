The elliptic curves in question all have algebraic j-invariant, so they\ncan be viewed as curves over Q-bar, the field of algebraic numbers. The\ncondition that they satisfy is that they must be isogenous to all their Galois\nconjugates. Borrowing a term from B.H. Gross, \"Arithmetic on elliptic curves\nwith complex multiplication,\" we say that the elliptic curves in question are\n\"Q-curves.\" Since all complex multiplication elliptic curves are Q-curves (with\nthis definition), and since they are all uniformized by modular forms\n(Shimura), we consider only non-CM curves for the remainder of this abstract.\nWe prove:\n  1. Let C be an elliptic curve over Q-bar. Then C is a Q-curve if and only if\nC is a Q-bar simple factor of an abelian variety A over Q whose algebra of\nQ-endomorphisms is a number field of degree dim(A). (We say that abelian\nvarieties A/Q with this property are of \"GL(2) type.\")\n  2. Suppose that Serre's conjecture on mod p modular forms are correct (Ref:\nDuke Journal, 1987). Then an abelian variety A over Q is of GL(2)-type if and\nonly if it is a simple factor (over Q) of the Jacobian J_1(N) for some integer\nN\\ge1.

Configurations that are half knots will be able to collapse, a\nnew argument for this collapse criterion is given in this paper.

I propose another more direct method and make\nuse of it when I estimate the probability for formation of both true and half\nknots by numerical simulations.Taking into account the chance of annihilation\nthe probability for collapse is found to be in the interval $p_{coll} \\in\n[0.01,0.04]$.

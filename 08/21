It indicates that a strongly interacting scalar sector in the minimal\nstandard model cannot exist; on the other hand low energy QCD phenomenology\nmight be interpreted as an indication that it could. We attack this puzzle\nusing the $1/N$ expansion and discover a simple criterion for selecting a\nlattice action that is more likely to produce a heavy Higgs particle. Depending\non the precise form of the limitation put on the cutoff effects, our large $N$\ncalculations, when combined with old numerical data, suggest that the Higgs\nmass bound might be around 750 $GeV$, which is higher than the $\\sim 650~GeV$\npreviously obtained. Preliminary numerical work indicates that an increase of\nat least 19\\% takes place at $N=4$ on the $F_4$ lattice when the old simple\naction is replaced with a new action (still containing only nearest neighbor\ninteractions) if one uses the lattice spacing as the physical cutoff for both\nactions. It appears that, while a QCD like theory could produce $M_H / F ~ \\sim\n6$, a meaningful ``minimal elementary Higgs'' theory cannot have $M_H/ F~\n\\gtapprox 3$.

For a particular power spectrum, predicted Sachs-Wolfe effects are\ncalculated for two cases: Gaussian (random phase) configuration, and a specific\nkind of non-Gaussian configuration. We obtain a result that the Sachs-Wolfe\neffect for the latter case is smaller when each temperature fluctuation is\nproperly normalized with respect to the corresponding mass fluctuation ${\\delta\nM\\over M}(R)$. The physical explanation and the generality of the result are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 1992 17:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

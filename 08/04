The method\ndivides physical space into rectangular cells which are assigned to processors\nand combines a serial local procedure with a nearest neighbor relaxation\nprocess. By controlling overhead and reducing inter-processor communication\nthis method attains good performance and speed-up. The complexity and scaling\nproperties of the algorithm are analyzed.\n  The algorithm has been used to simulate large 2d Ising systems (up to 27808 X\n27808 sites) with Swendsen-Wang dynamics. Typical updating times on the order\nof 82 nanosecs/site and efficiencies larger than 90% have been obtained using\n256 processors on the CM-5 supercomputer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 1992 23:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1992 16:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The proper factorization of short- and\nlong-distance contributions in the operator product expansion is discussed in\ndetail. It is found that to accomplish this task rigorously the operator\nproduct expansion has to be performed in terms of non-normal-ordered\ncondensates.

Among the\noperators considered are ``filled Wilson loops\" which are the most reasonable\ncounterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of lattice\nQCD. The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain\n2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions. The\n``string tension\" $\\alpha'$, which is the exponent in the area law for the\n``filled Wilson loop\" is equal to the free energy density of the corresponding\nstatistical system. The continuum limit of the Kazakov--Migdal model\ncorresponds to the critical point of this statistical system. We argue that in\nthe large $N$ limit this critical point occurs at zero temperature. In this\ncase we express $\\alpha'$ in terms of the distribution density of eigenvalues\nof the matrix-valued master field. We show that the properties of the continuum\nlimit and the description of how this limit is approached is very unusual and\ndiffers drastically from what occurs in both the Wilson theory ($S\\propto({\\rm\nTr}\\prod U +{\\rm c.c.})$) and in the ``adjoint'' theory ($S\\propto\\vert{\\rm\nTr}\\prod U\\vert^2$). Instead, the continuum limit of the model appears to be\nintriguingly similar to a $c>1$ string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 1992 06:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

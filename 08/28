The Ga $3d$ electrons are treated as band states, and no shape\napproximation is made to the potential and charge density. The influence of $d$\nelectrons on the band structure, charge density, and bonding properties is\nanalyzed. It is found that due to the energy resonance of the Ga 3$d$ states\nwith nitrogen 2$s$ states, the cation $d$ bands are not inert, and features\nunusual for a III-V compound are found in the lower part of the valence band\nand in the valence charge density and density of states. To clarify the\ninfluence of the Ga $d$ states on the cohesive properties, additional full and\nfrozen--overlapped-core calculations were performed for GaN, cubic ZnS, GaAs,\nand Si. The results show, in addition to the known importance of non-linear\ncore-valence exchange-correlation corrections, that an explicit description of\nclosed-shell repulsion effects is necessary to obtain accurate results for GaN\nand similar systems. In summary, GaN appears to be somewhat exceptional among\nthe III-V compounds and reminiscent of II-VI materials, in that its band\nstructure and cohesive properties are sensitive to a proper treatment of the\ncation $d$ bands, as a result of the presence of the latter in the valence band\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 1992 16:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The adjoint plaquette has a clear\ndiscontinuity across the phase transition, whereas the plaquette in the\nfundamental representation is always zero in accordance with Elitzur's theorem.\nThe density of small $Z_2$ monopoles shows very little variation and is always\nlarge. We also find that the model has extra local U(1) symmetries which do not\nexist in the case of the standard adjoint theory. As a result, we are able to\nshow that two of the angles parameterizing the gauge field completely decouple\nfrom the theory and the continuum limit defined around the critical point can\ntherefore not be `QCD'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 1992 18:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

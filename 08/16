Measuring\nnumerically the tilt-dependent velocity we construct a set of stochastic\ncontinuum equations describing the fluctuations in the model\n  The scaling predicted by the equations are studied analytically using dynamic\nrenormalization group and compared with simulation results. When the coupling\nis symmetric, the well known KPZ exponents are recovered. If one of the systems\nis fluctuating independently, an increase in the roughness exponent is observed\nfor the other one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 1992 19:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\nexponential decay of the wavefunction is modulated by a field dependent\namplitude J(t) which depends sensitively on the value of alpha (the magnetic\nflux per plaquette in units of a flux quantum, t is the distance from the\nboundary). While for rational values p/q, the envelope of J(t) increases as\n2**t/q, the behavior for irrational alpha is erratic with an aperiodic\nstructure which changes drastically with alpha. For algebraic alpha it is found\nthat J(t) increases as a power law t**b(alpha) while it grows faster for\ntranscendental alpha. This is very different from the growth rate exp{sqrt(t)}\ntypical for random phases. The theoretical analysis is extended to lattices in\nwhich the distances between adjacent layers increase as r**n with n>0.\nDifferent behavior of J(t;n) is found in various regimes of n. It changes from\nperiodic for small n to random like for large n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 1992 18:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

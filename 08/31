There are three types of non-standard electric charge, given by\n$Q_{st} + \\epsilon(L_i - L_j)$, where $i, j = e, \\mu, \\tau$ $(i \\neq j)$,\n$Q_{st}$ is standard electric charge, $L_i$ is a family-lepton--number, and\n$\\epsilon$ is an arbitrary parameter which is put equal to zero in the usual\nincarnation of the MSM. These three non-standard electric charges are of\nconsiderable theoretical interest because they are compatible with the MSM\nLagrangian and $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y$ gauge anomaly\ncancellation. The two most conspicuous implications of such non-standard\nelectric charges are the presence of two generations of massless charged\nneutrinos and a breakdown in electromagnetic universality for $e$, $\\mu$ and\n$\\tau$. We use results from (i) charge conservation in $\\beta$-decay, (ii)\nphysical consequences of charged atoms in various contexts, (iii) the anomalous\nmagnetic moments of charged leptons, (iv) neutrino-electron scattering, (v)\nenergy loss in red giant and white dwarf stars, and (vi) limits on a\ncosmologically induced thermal photon mass, to place bounds on $\\epsilon$.\nWhile the constraints derived for $\\epsilon$ 10^{-21}$), the $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$\ncase allows $\\epsilon$ to be as large as $10^{-14}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1992 06:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

We obtain a\nbilocal effective meson action with a potential kernel given in relativistic\ncovariant form. The corresponding Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter\nequations are investigated in detail. By introducing weak interactions into the\ntheory we study heavy meson properties as decay constants and semileptonic\ndecay amplitudes. Thereby, the transition from the bilocal field description to\nthe heavy quark effective theory is discussed. Considering as example the\nsemileptonic decay of a pseudoscalar $B$--meson into a pseudoscalar $D$--meson\nwe obtain an integral expression for the corresponding Isgur--Wise function in\nterms of meson wave functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1992 08:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Then we study the action of a subset of\nthe $SL(2,R)$ group of electric-magnetic duality rotations that generates a\nnon-trivial axion field on those solutions. This group of transformations is an\nexact symmetry of the $N=4$ $d=4$ ungauged supergravity equations of motion.

I argue that nonrenormalizable terms\nrestrict the gauge symmetry, at the Planck scale, to be $SU(3)\\times\nSU(2)\\times U(1)_{B-L}\\times U(1)_{T_{3_R}}$ rather than $SU(3)\\times\nSU(2)\\times U(1)_Y$. I show that breaking the gauge symmetry directly to the\nStandard Model leads to breaking of supersymmetry at the Planck scale, or to\ndimension four, baryon and lepton violating, operators. I show that if the\ngauge symmetry is broken directly to the Standard Model the cubic level\nsolution to the F and D flatness constraints is violated by higher order terms,\nwhile if $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ remains unbroken at the Planck scale, the cubic\nlevel solution is valid to all orders of nonrenormalizable terms. I discuss the\nHiggs and fermion mass spectrum. I demonstrate that realistic, hierarchical,\nfermion mass spectrum can be generated in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 1992 14:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

(ii) Proton decay from dimension four and\ndimension five operators is suppressed due to gauged $U(1)$ symmetries. (iii)\nThere exist Higgs doublets from two distinct sectors, which can generate\nrealistic symmetry breaking. (iv) These models explain the top--bottom mass\nhierarchy. At the trilinear level of the superpotential only the top quark gets\na non vanishing mass term. The bottom quark and the lighter quarks and leptons\nget their mass terms from non renormalizable terms. This result is correlated\nwith the requirement of a supersymmetric vacuum at the Planck scale.

For $n < 0.87$, gravity waves perturb the CMBR by a\nlarger amount than density perturbations, whereas for $n > 0.87$ the reverse is\ntrue. %For nearly exponential inflation, on the other hand, the contribution to\nthe %microwave anisotropy from scalar density perturbations always exceeds\n%that due to gravity waves. Normalising the amplitude of the density\nperturbation spectrum at large scales, using the observed value of the COBE\nquadrupole, we determine $(\\delta M /M)_{16}$ -- the rms density contrast on\nscales $\\sim 16 h_{50}^{-1}$ Mpc, for cosmological models with cold dark\nmatter. We find that for $n < 0.75$, a large amount of biasing is required in\norder to reconcile theory with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 1992 14:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The first stage is a\nconventional second order (or weakly first order) transition in which the\nsymmetry is broken. Shortly thereafter follows a first order transition with\nbarrier penetration, bubble production and loss of thermal equilibrium. For\nHiggs potentials with CP violation, we show that the second stage of the\ntransition has all the features required for weak scale baryogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 1992 21:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

The two systems\nare distinguished by different target spaces ($\\Z$ and $\\R$, respectively) as\nfar as {\\it observables} are concerned. We argue that target space loop\ncorrelators should coincide in the two models and demonstrate this for a number\nof examples. As a consequence some interesting generic observations about the\nstructure of two-dimensional string theory may be made: Restricting to a\ndiscrete target space leads to {\\it factorization} of amplitudes and thus to\nvery simple sewing rules. It is also demonstrated that the restriction to the\ndiscrete target space still allows to calculate the correlation functions of\ntachyon operators in the unrestricted theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 1992 18:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

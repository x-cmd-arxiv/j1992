In order to be able to perform such\ncomputations one needs an algorithm which for any given $N$ and a given compact\nfour-dimensional manifold $M$ constructs all possible triangulations of $M$\nwith $\\leq N$ simplices. Our first result is that such algorithm does not\nexist. Then we discuss recursion-theoretic limitations of any algorithm\ndesigned to perform approximate calculations of sums over all possible\ntriangulations of a compact four-dimensional manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 1992 03:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

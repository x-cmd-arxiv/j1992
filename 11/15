Such a theory was first considered by Witten as a possible\ngravitational counterpart of topological Yang-Mills theory, but several\nproblems left it incomplete. The key in our approach is to realise a theory\nwhich describes deformations of conformally self-dual gravitational instantons.\nWe first identify the appropriate elliptic complex which does precisely this.\nBy applying the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we calculate the number of\nindependent deformations of a given gravitational instanton which preserve its\nself-duality. We then quantise topological conformal gravity by BRST\ngauge-fixing, and discover how the quantum theory is naturally described by the\nabove complex. Indeed, it is a process which closely parallels that of the\nYang-Mills theory, and we show how the partition function generates an uncanny\ngravitational analogue of the first Donaldson invariant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 1992 17:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

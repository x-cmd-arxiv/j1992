Although the\ngauge-fixing procedure preserved the worldsheet N=2 superconformal invariance\nof the twistor-string, it broke the target-space SO(9,1) super-Poincar\\'e\ninvariance down to an SU(4)xU(1) subgroup. In this paper, generators for the\nSO(9,1) super-Poincar\\'e transformations, as well as manifestly covariant\nvertex operators, are explicitly constructed out of the gauge-fixed matter\nfields. The earlier calculated amplitudes are then expressed in manifestly\nLorentz-covariant notation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 1992 15:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

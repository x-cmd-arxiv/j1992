The\napproximation accurately reproduces previous results for the gravitational\nradiation from the collision of two scalar-field vacuum bubbles. Using a bubble\nnucleation rate given by $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_0 e^{\\beta t}$, we simulate a phase\ntransition by colliding 20 to 200 bubbles; the fraction of vacuum energy\nreleased into gravity waves is $E_{\\rm GW}/E_{\\rm vac} = 0.06(H/\\beta)^2$ and\nthe peak of the spectrum occurs at $\\omega_{\\rm max}=1.6\\beta$ ($H^2=8\\pi G\\rho\n/3$ is the Hubble constant associated with the false-vacuum phase). The\nspectrum is very similar to that in the two-bubble case, except that the\nefficiency of gravity-wave generation is about five times higher, presumably\ndue to the fact that a given bubble collides with many others. Finally, we\nconsider two further ``statistical'' approximations, where the gravitational\nradiation is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by\nthe distribution of bubble sizes. These approximations provide reasonable\nestimates of the gravitational-wave spectrum with far less computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 1992 20:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A set of physically\nsensible assumptions and the cosmological requirement of a not too young\nUniverse give us a rather restrictive set of allowed points in the parameter\nspace, which characterizes this model. This set implies the existence of\ninteresting correlations among various masses: either the lightest chargino and\nthe next-to-lightest neutralino are below $\\approx100\\GeV$ (and therefore\nobservable at the Tevatron) or the lightest Higgs boson is below\n$\\approx50\\GeV$ (and therefore observable at LEP I-II).

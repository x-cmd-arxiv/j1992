The problem of the frozen formalism is to explain how\ndynamics is possible when all observables are constants of the motion. An\nexplicit model of a measurement-interaction in a parametrized Hamiltonian\nsystem is used to elucidate the relationship between three definitions of\nobservables---as something one observes, as self-adjoint operators, and as\noperators which commute with all of the constraints. There is no inconsistency\nin the frozen formalism when the measurement process is properly understood.\nThe projection operator description of measurement is criticized as an\nover-idealization which treats measurement as instantaneous and\nnon-destructive. A more careful description of measurement necessarily involves\ninteractions of non-vanishing duration.

We show that in the minimal case, namely when the special\ngeometry prepotential F(X) is a quadratic polynomial, the theory has a so far\nunknown on shell U(1) symmetry, that we name R-duality. R-duality is a\ngeneralization of the chiral-dual on shell symmetry of N=2 pure supergravity\nand of the R-symmetry of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. Thanks to this, the\ntheory can be topologically twisted and topologically shifted, precisely as\npure N=2 supergravity, to yield a natural coupling of topological gravity to\ntopological Yang-Mills theory. The gauge-fixing condition that emerges from the\ntwisting is the self- duality condition on the gauge field-stength and on the\nspin connection. Hence our theory reduces to intersection theory in the\nmoduli-space of gauge instantons living in gravitational instanton backgrounds.\nWe remark that the topological Yang-Mills theory we obtain by taking the flat\nspace limit of our gravity coupled Lagrangian is different from the Donaldson\ntheory constructed by Witten. Whether this difference is substantial and what\nits geometrical implications may be is yet to be seen.

These models are UV finite. The $2+N$-dimensional target space metric\ncan be explicitly determined for a class of supersymmetric sigma models with\n$N$-dimensional `transverse' part of the target space being homogeneous\nK\\\"ahler. The corresponding `transverse' sub-theory is an $n=2$ supersymmetric\nsigma model with the exact $\\gb$-function coinciding with its one-loop\nexpression. For example, the finite $D=4$ model has $O(3)$ supersymmetric sigma\nmodel as its `transverse' part. Moreover, there exists a non-trivial dilaton\nfield such that the Weyl invariance conditions are also satisfied, i.e. the\nresulting models correspond to string vacua. Generic solutions are represented\nin terms of the RG flow in `transverse' theory. We suggest a possible\napplication of the constructed Weyl invariant sigma models to quantisation of\n$2d$ gravity. They may be interpreted as `effective actions' of the quantum\n$2d$ dilaton gravity coupled to a (non-conformal) $N$-dimensional `matter'\ntheory.

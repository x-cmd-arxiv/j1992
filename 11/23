These measured angles are compared\nto a theoretical approximation.

The density of this matter can be increased\nby decreasing the hypersphere radius. As in the array calculations one\nencounters a transition to a distinct high density phase characterized by a\ndelocalization in energy and baryon charge and by increased symmetries. We will\nargue that the high density phase has to be interpreted as chirally restored\none. The arguments are based on the formation of complete chiral multiplets and\nthe vanishing of the pionic massless Goldstone modes in the high-density\nfluctuation spectrum. We show that the restoration of chiral symmetry is common\nto any chirally invariant extension of the usual Skyrme model - whether via\nhigher-order contact terms or via the introduction of stabilizing vector mesons\nwhich act over a finite range.

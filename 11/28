(We do not require\nFrechet algebras to be m-convex.) Let G be a Lie group, not necessarily con-\nnected, which acts on both $A$ and B by *-automorphisms, and let \\s be a sub-\nmultiplicative function from G to the nonnegative real numbers. If \\s and the\naction of G on A satisfy certain simple properties, we define a dense Frechet\n*-subalgebra G\\rtimes^{\\s} A of the crossed product L^{1}(G, B). Our algebra\nconsists of differentiable A-valued functions on G, rapidly vanishing in \\s.\n  We give conditions on the action of G on A which imply the m-convexity of the\ndense subalgebra G\\rtimes^{\\s}A. A locally convex algebra is said to be m-con-\nvex if there is a family of submultiplicative seminorms for the topology of the\nalgebra. The property of m-convexity is important for a Frechet algebra, and is\nuseful in modern operator theory.\n  If G acts as a transformation group on a manifold M, we develop a class of\ndense subalgebras for the crossed product L^{1}(G, C_{0}(M)), where C_{0}(M)\ndenotes the continuous functions on M vanishing at infinity with the sup norm\ntopology.We define Schwartz functions S(M) on M, which are differentiable with\nrespect to some group action on M, and are rapidly vanishing with respect to\nsome scale on M. We then form a dense m-convex Frechet *-subalgebra G\\rtimes^\n{\\s} S(M) of rapidly vanishing, G-differentiable functions from G to S(M).\n  If the reciprocal of \\s is in L^{p}(G) for some p, we prove that our group\nalgebras S^{\\s}(G) are nuclear Frechet spaces, and that G\\rtimes^{\\s}A is the\nprojective completion S^{\\s}(G) \\otimes A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 1992 23:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

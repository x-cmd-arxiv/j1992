This is a summary of what I\nthought were the most interesting things discussed at Blois: (1) The\nnear-success of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in predicting the COBE fluctuation\namplitude, which favors the hypothesis that structure formed in the universe\nthrough gravitational collapse. (2) The indications that $\\Omega\\approx1$ and\nthat the power spectrum has a little more power on supercluster and larger\nscales than CDM. These are suggested by the IRAS and CfA redshift surveys and\nPOTENT galaxy peculiar velocity analysis, and also by the COBE data. (3) The\nconsequent demise of CDM and the rise of hybrid schemes such as Cold+Hot Dark\nMatter (C+HDM). (4) The possible implications for neutrino masses and mixings,\nand for cosmology, of the recent results on solar neutrinos. (5) The first\ndiscovery of TeV $\\gamma$ rays from an extragalactic source, which was\nannounced at Blois. I also summarize here a number of the exciting ongoing and\nplanned experiments and observations discussed at Blois: CERN experiments on\n$\\nu_\\mu \\nu_\\tau$ oscillations, which may be sufficiently sensitive to detect\nthe $\\nu_\\tau$ if\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 1992 03:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Euclidian\neffective action is regularized using Schwinger's proper time method. Numerical\nresults for the static soliton energy are presented for the cases without and\nwith vector and axialvector fields. It is found that the baryon number is\ncarried by the polarized Dirac sea of the quarks if the $a_1$ meson is included\nin contrast to the case without $a_1$ where the baryon number resides on\nvalence quarks. Thus the model strongly supports the picture of the baryon as a\ntopological soliton of the meson fields. Including the $\\omega $ vector meson\nleads to a non--vanishing imaginary part of the Euclidian effective action even\nfor static solitons. Leaving the chiral circle, i.e.\\ including the isoscalar\nscalar meson, the soliton first seems unstable. However, we demonstrate that a\n$\\phi ^4$ term stabilizes the soliton. Finally, the self--consistent\ntwo--flavor chiral soliton is embedded in the SU(3) flavor group and\ncollectively quantized. The predicted mass splittings for the low--lying\nbaryons with different hypercharge are in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental data if the physical value for the kaon decay constant is\nsubstituted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 1992 09:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular we study the flow in the\nvicinity of phase transitions with a first-order character, a matter that has\nbeen controversial for years. We observe that the flow is continuous and\nsingle-valued, even on the phase transition surface, provided that the\nrenormalized Hamiltonian exist. The characteristics of such a flow are in\nagreement with the Nienhuis-Nauenberg standard scenario, and in disagreement\nwith the ``discontinuity scenario'' proposed by some authors and recently\ndisproved by van Enter, Fern\\'andez and Sokal for a large class of models (with\nreal interactions). However, there are some points in the space of interactions\nfor which a renormalized Hamiltonian cannot be defined. This pathological\nbehavior is similar, and in some sense complementary, to the one pointed out by\nGriffiths, Pearce and Israel for Ising models. We explicitly see that if the\ntransformation is truncated so as to preserve a Hamiltonian description, the\nresulting flow becomes discontinuous and multivalued at some of these points.\nThis suggests a possible explanation for the numerical results that motivated\nthe ``discontinuity scenario''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 1992 12:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

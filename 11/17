The partion functions do, however, contain divergencies due to the\ntime-like direction of the $SU(1,1)$ manifold. The two classes of theories have\nthe corresponding central charges $c=9,6,5,9/2,\\ldots$ and\n$c=9,15,21,27,\\ldots$. Subtracting two from the latter series of central\ncharges we get the Gervais-Neveu series $c-2=7,13,19,25$. This suggests a\nrelationship between the $SU(1,1)$ string and the Liouville theory, similar to\nthe one found in the $c=1$ string. Modular invariance is also demonstrated for\nthe principal continous representations. Furthermore, we present new results\nfor the Euclidean coset $SU(1,1)/U(1)$. The same two classes of theories will\nbe possible here and will have central charges $c=8,5,4,\\dots$ and\n$c=8,14,20,26,\\ldots$, where the latter class includes the critical 2d black\nhole. The partition functions for the coset theory are convergent.(Talk\npresented by S.H. at the 16'th Johns Hopkins' Workshop, G\\\"oteborg, Sweden,\nJune 8-10, 1992)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 1992 09:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Through this procedure, we compute all the\nrings from dihedral ${\\bf CP}^1$ orbifolds; we note a similarity with rings\nderived from perturbed $D-$series superpotentials of the $A-D-E$ classification\nof $N = 2$ minimal models. We then consider ${\\bf CP}^2/D_4,$ and show how the\ntechniques of topological-anti-topological fusion might be used to compute\ntwist field correlation functions for nonabelian orbifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 1992 06:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Carne, Cole and Gamelin show\nthat a space has this property and the Dunford-Pettis property if and only if\nit is Schur. Herein is defined a reasonable generalization of the\nDunford--Pettis property using polynomials of a fixed homogeneity. It is shown,\nfor example, that a Banach space will has the $P_N$ Dunford--Pettis property if\nand only if every weakly compact $N-$homogeneous polynomial (in the sense of\nRyan) on the space is completely continuous. A certain geometric condition,\ninvolving estimates on spreading models and implied by nontrivial type, is\nshown to be sufficient to imply that a space is polynomially Schur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 1992 16:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

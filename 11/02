These higher dimensional manifolds are\nspaces with quantized positive Ricci curvature and therefore do not, a priori,\ndescribe consistent string vacua. It is nevertheless possible to derive from\nthese manifolds the massless spectra of critical string groundstates. For a\nsubclass of these noncritical theories it is also possible to explicitly\nconstruct Calabi--Yau manifolds from the higher dimensional spaces. Thus the\nnew class of theories makes contact with the standard framework of string\ncompactification. This class of manifolds is more general than that of\nCalabi--Yau manifolds because it contains spaces which correspond to critical\nstring vacua with no K\\\"ahler deformations, i.e. no antigenerations, hence\nproviding mirrors of rigid Calabi--Yau manifolds. The constructions reviewed\nhere lead to new insight into the relation between exactly solvable models and\ntheir mean field theories on the one hand and Calabi--Yau manifolds on the\nother, leading, for instance, to a modification of Gepner's conjecture.

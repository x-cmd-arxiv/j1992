Except for D=1 (the polymer case), this model\ncannot be mapped onto a local field theory. We show that the use of intrinsic\ndistance geometry allows for a rigorous construction of the high-temperature\nperturbative expansion and for analytic continuation in the manifold dimension\nD. We study the renormalization properties of the model for 0<D<2, and show\nthat for d<d* where d*=2D/(2-D) is the upper critical dimension, the\nperturbative expansion is UV finite, while UV divergences occur as poles at\nd=d*. The standard proof of perturbative renormalizability for local field\ntheories (the BPH theorem) does not apply to this model. We prove perturbative\nrenormalizability to all orders by constructing a subtraction operator based on\na generalization of the Zimmermann forests formalism, and which makes the\ntheory finite at d=d*. This subtraction operation corresponds to a\nrenormalization of the coupling constant of the model (strength of the\ninteraction with the impurity). The existence of a Wilson function, of an\nepsilon-expansion around the critical dimension, of scaling laws for d<d* in\nthe repulsive case, and of non-trivial critical exponents of the delocalization\ntransition for d>d* in the attractive case is thus established. To our\nknowledge, this provides the first proof of renormalizability for a model of\nextended objects, and should be applicable to the study of self-avoidance\ninteractions for random manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 1992 15:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Then, it proposes a new baryonic force\nfor the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the\nliterature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the\nexpansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of\nthe number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe\nis a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where\n$x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested\nthat Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and,\ntherefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed\nuniverse is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper,\nexplains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral\ngalaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble\nconstant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks\nwhich may be the true elementary particles. The paper also gives a physical\nexplanation for quark confinement. The energies of baryon states are calculated\nin a simple manner. The paper proposes the existence of four more bosons, one\nfor the superweak interaction and three for the superstrong interaction. The\nsix figures will be sent by mail upon request.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 1992 15:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The functional measures are\nexplicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions corresponding to the\nHamiltonian and the momentum constraints are derived. It is pointed out that\nthe constraints form the Virasoro algebra without central charge. In ADM\nformalism the measures are very ambiguous, but in our formalism they are\nexplicitly defined. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalism\ncome out. A singularity appears at $\\df^2 =\\kappa (>0) $, where $\\kappa\n=(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of matter fields. Behind the singularity\nthe quantum mechanical region $\\kappa > \\df^2 >0 $ extends, where the sign of\nthe kinetic term in the Hamiltonian constraint changes. If $\\kappa <0 $, the\nsingularity disappears. We discuss the quantum dynamics of black hole and then\ngive a suggestion for the resolution of the information loss paradox. We also\nargue the quantization of the spherically symmetric gravitational system in 3+1\ndimensions.

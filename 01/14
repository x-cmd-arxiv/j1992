Lett. It is shown that the\n$A_n$--W-geometry corresponds to chiral surfaces in $CP^n$. This is comes out\nby discussing 1) the extrinsic geometries of chiral surfaces (Frenet-Serret and\nGauss-Codazzi equations) 2) the KP coordinates (W-parametrizations) of the\ntarget-manifold, and their fermionic (tau-function) description, 3) the\nintrinsic geometries of the associated chiral surfaces in the Grassmannians,\nand the associated higher instanton- numbers of W-surfaces. For regular points,\nthe Frenet-Serret equations for $CP^n$--W-surfaces are shown to give the\ngeometrical meaning of the $A_n$-Toda Lax pair, and of the conformally-reduced\nWZNW models, and Drinfeld-Sokolov equations. KP coordinates are used to show\nthat W-transformations may be extended as particular diffeomorphisms of the\ntarget-space. This leads to higher-dimensional generalizations of the WZNW and\nDS equations. These are related with the Zakharov- Shabat equations. For\nsingular points, global Pl\\\"ucker formulae are derived by combining the\n$A_n$-Toda equations with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem written for each of the\nassociated surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 1992 15:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

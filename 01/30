We apply a\nLian-Zuckerman $SO(2,\\bbc)$ ($(p,q)$ - dependent) rotation to Witten's $c^M =\n1$ chiral ground ring. We show that the ring structure generated by the\n(relative BRST cohomology) discrete states in the (matter $\\otimes$ Liouville\n$\\otimes$ ghosts) Fock module may be obtained by this rotation. We give also\nexplicit formulae for the discrete states. For some of them we use new formulae\nfor $c <1$ Fock modules singular vectors which we present in terms of Schur\npolynomials generalizing the $c=1$ expressions of Goldstone, while the rest of\nthe discrete states we obtain by finding the proper $SO(2,\\bbc)$ rotation. Our\nformulae give the extra physical states (arising from the relative BRST\ncohomology) on the boundaries of the $p \\times q$ rectangles of the conformal\nlattice and thus all such states in $(1,q)$ or $(p,1)$ models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 1992 18:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

We consider\na massless minimally coupled scalar field, initially in the spherically\nsymmetric `mini-superspace' approximation, and then in the `midi-superspace'\napproximation, where non-spherically symmetric perturbations are linearized\nabout a spherically symmetric mini-superspace background. Our approach suggests\nthat there are higher derivative corrections to the vertex operator from the\nnon-spherically symmetric perturbations. This is compared directly with the\napproach based on complete wormhole solutions to the equations of motion where\nit has been claimed that the semi-classical vertex operator is exactly given by\nthe lowest order term, to all orders in the size of the wormhole throat.

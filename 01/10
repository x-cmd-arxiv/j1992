Fluctuating modes have normalizable\nwavefunctions. In the context of 2D gravity and ``non-critical'' string theory\nthese are called macroscopic states. The theory is independent of the initial\nEuclidean background values of these modes. Non-fluctuating modes have\nnon-normalizable wavefunctions and correspond to microscopic states. The theory\ndepends on the background value of these non-fluctuating modes, at least to all\norders in perturbation theory. They are superselection parameters and should\nnot be minimized over. Such superselection parameters are well known in field\ntheory. Examples in string theory include the couplings $t_k$ (including the\ncosmological constant) in the matrix models and the mass of the two-dimensional\nEuclidean black hole. We use our analysis to argue for the finiteness of the\nstring perturbation expansion around these backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 1992 20:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 1992 22:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

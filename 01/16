These are shown to be the symmetry\nstructure of the super Toda models, which can be obtained from the WZNW theory\nby Hamiltonian reduction. A classification, according to the conformal spin\ndefined by an improved energy-momentum tensor, is dicussed in general terms for\nall super Lie algebras whose simple roots are fermionic . A detailed discussion\nemploying the Dirac bracket structure and an explicit construction of\nW-algebras for the cases of $OSP(1,2)$, $OSP(2,2)$ , $OSP(3,2)$ and $D(2,1 \\mid\n\\alpha )$ are given. The $N=1$ and $N=2$ super conformal algebras are discussed\nin the pertinent cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 1992 11:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

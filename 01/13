The measure is concretely represented by adopting\ntwo kind of decompositions of the gauge field degrees of freedom which are most\nfamiliarly used in the covariant and canonical path integrals respectively. It\nis shown that the two representations are different by an anomalous Jacobian\nfactor from each other and also that the factor has a direct relationship to an\nuncancellation factor of the contributions from the Faddeev-Popov ghost and the\nunphysical part of the gauge field to the covariant one-loop partition\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 1992 03:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

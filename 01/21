We show\nthat they admit a first-class subsystem from which they can be recovered by\ngauge-fixing, and that the non-degenerate constraints can be handled by\nprevious methods. The degenerate constraints present a new situation in which\nthe natural primary field basis for the gauge-invariants is rational rather\nthan polynomial. We give an algorithm for constructing the rational basis and\nconverting the base elements to polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 1992 03:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 1992 20:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It makes use of neither gauge\nconditions nor functional integrals and needs only ideas known from QCD and\nquantum gravity. It gives Witten's conformal edge states in a simple way when\nthe spatial slice is a disc. Here we extend the formalism by including sources\nas well. The quantum states of a source with a fixed spatial location are shown\nto be those of a conformal family, a result also discovered first by Witten.\nThe internal states of a source are not thus associated with just a single ray\nof a Hilbert space. Vertex operators for both abelian and nonabelian sources\nare constructed. The regularized abelian Wilson line is proved to be a vertex\noperator. We also argue in favor of a similar nonabelian result. The\nspin-statistics theorem is established for Chern-Simons dynamics even though\nthe sources are not described by relativistic quantum fields. The proof employs\ngeometrical methods which we find are strikingly transparent and pleasing. It\nis based on the research of European physicists about ``fields localized on\ncones.''\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 1992 20:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Fixing this gauge leaves a\nU(1) Kac-Moody algebra of residual symmetry, generated by a conformal tensor of\nrank two and a conformal scalar. Another is that the BRST charge made from\nthese currents is nilpotent when the action includes a linear dilaton\nbackground, independent of the particular value of the dilaton gradient.\nSpacetime Lorentz invariance in this theory is still elusive, however, because\nof the linear dilaton background and the nature of the gauge symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 1992 21:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

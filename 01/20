Making use of the fact that the matrices evolve in Langevin time,\nthe Jacobian from matrix coordinates to collective modes is similar to the\ncorresponding Jacobian in $d = 1$ matrix models. The collective field theory is\nanalyzed in the planar limit. The saddle point eigenvalue distribution is the\none that defines the original multicritical point and therefore exhibits the\nappropriate scaling behaviour. Some comments on the nonperturbative properties\nof the collective field theory as well as comments on the Virasoro constraints\nassociated with the loop equations are made at the end of this letter. There we\nalso make some remarks on the fermionic formulation of the model and its\nintegrability, as a nonlocal version of the non linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 1992 12:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

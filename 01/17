An explicit solution in the leading order in $N$ is\npresented. The critical behaviour is given by the second derivative of the free\nenergy in $\\alpha$ which appears to be a pure logarithm, that is a feature of\n$c=1$ theories. Various critical regimes are possible, some of them corresponds\nto critical points of the usual Penner model, but there exists an infinite set\nof multi-critical points which differ by values of scaling dimensions of proper\nconformal operators. Their correlators with the puncture operator are given in\ngenus zero by Legendre polynomials whose argument is determined by an analog of\nthe string equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 1992 21:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

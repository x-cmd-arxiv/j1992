Our starting point is the notion that the string field\ncoordinates $X(\\sigma)$ and the momenta $P(\\sigma)$ are background independent\nobjects whose field algebra is always the same; backgrounds correspond to\ninequivalent representations of this algebra. We propose classical string field\nsolutions relating any two toroidal backgrounds and discuss the space where\nthese solutions are defined.\n  String field theories formulated around dual backgrounds are shown to be\nrelated by a homogeneous field redefinition, and are therefore equivalent, if\nand only if their string field coupling constants are identical. Using this\ndiscrete equivalence of backgrounds and the classical solutions we find\ndiscrete symmetry transformations of the string field leaving the string action\ninvariant. These symmetries, which are spontaneously broken for generic\nbackgrounds, are shown to generate the full group of duality symmetries, and in\ngeneral are seen to arise from the string field gauge group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 1992 23:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

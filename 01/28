The full structure, at the $SU(2)$ radius, has a\nnatural description in terms of abelian gauge theory on a certain three\ndimensional cone $Q$. We describe precisely how symmetry currents are\nconstructed from the discrete states, explaining the role of the ``descent\nequations.'' In the uncompactified theory, we compute the action of the\nsymmetries on the tachyon field, and isolate the features that lead to\nnonlinear terms in this action. The resulting symmetry structure is interpreted\nin terms of a homotopy Lie algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 1992 02:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}

The\nanomalies that arise in quantum W-gravity are discussed, with particular\nattention to the new types of anomalies that arise for non-linearly realised\nsymmetries and to the relation between path-integral anomalies and non-closure\nof the quantum current algebra. Models in which all anomalies are cancelled by\nghost contributions lead to new generalisations of string theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 1992 15:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 1992 12:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Close analysis of two representative papers reveals a\nmixture of nice new observations, error bounds repackaged in new language,\nmisdirected examples, and misleading theorems.\n  Some elements in the framework of IBCT, erected to support a rigorous yet\nflexible theory, make it difficult to judge whether a model is off-target or\nreasonably realistic.

Yet the information\nitself usually comes from an algorithm, so the distinction clouds the issues\nand can lead to true but misleading inferences. Another troublesome aspect of\nIBCT is a free parameter $F$, the class of admissible problem instances. By\noverlooking $F$'s membership fee, the theory sometimes distorts the economics\nof problem solving in a way reminiscent of agricultural subsidies.\n  The current theory's surprising results pertain only to unnatural situations,\nand its genuinely new insights might serve us better if expressed in the\nconventional modes of error analysis and approximation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

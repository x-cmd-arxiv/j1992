We\ndescribe in detail two different types of black hole hair that decay\nexponentially at long range. The first type is associated with discrete gauge\ncharge and the screening is due to the Higgs mechanism. The second type is\nassociated with color magnetic charge, and the screening is due to color\nconfinement. In both cases, we perform semi-classical calculations of the\neffect of the hair on local observables outside the horizon, and on black hole\nthermodynamics. These effects are generated by virtual cosmic strings, or\nvirtual electric flux tubes, that sweep around the event horizon. The effects\nof discrete gauge charge are non-perturbative in $\\hbar$, but the effects of\ncolor magnetic charge become $\\hbar$-independent in a suitable limit. We\npresent an alternative treatment of discrete gauge charge using dual variables,\nand examine the possibility of black hole hair associated with discrete {\\it\nglobal} symmetry. We draw the distinction between {\\it primary} hair, which\nendows a black hole with new quantum numbers, and {\\it secondary} hair, which\ndoes not, and we point out some varieties of secondary hair that occur in the\nstandard model of particle physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 1992 19:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

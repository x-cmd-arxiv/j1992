Such domain walls are shown to saturate the Bogomol'nyi\nbound of wall energy per unit area. We find \\sl static \\rm and \\sl reflection\nasymmetric \\rm domain wall solutions of the self-duality equations for the\nmetric and the matter fields. Our result establishes a new class of domain\nwalls beyond those previously classified. As a corollary, we define a precise\nnotion of vacuum degeneracy in the supergravity theories. In addition, we found\nexamples of global supersymmetric domain walls that do not have an analog when\ngravity is turned on. This result establishes that in the case of extended\ntopological defects gravity plays a crucial, nontrivial role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

Several\nresults from there are strengthened, in particular:\n  1. If T is a \"natural\" embedding of l_2^n into L_1 then, for any well-bounded\nfactorization of T through an L_1 space in the form T=uv with v of norm one, u\nwell-preserves a copy of l_1^k with k exponential in n.\n  2. Any norm one operator from a C(K) space which well-preserves a copy of\nl_2^n also well-preserves a copy of l_{\\infty}^k with k exponential in n.\n  As an application of these and other results we show the existence, for any\nn, of an n-dimensional space which well-embeds into a space with an\nunconditional basis only if the latter contains a copy of l_{\\infty}^k with k\nexponential in n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 1992 04:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

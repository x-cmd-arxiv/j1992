The singular case is treated as a special case and does not arise in the\ncontinuous limit of zero instanton size. We find that the orbits are either\ncircular or open, which is a solitonic analogy with the motion of an electron\naround a magnetic monopole, although the system we consider is quantitatively\ndifferent. We emphasize that at long distance this geometry does not satisfy\nthe inverse square law, but satisfies the inverse cubic law. If the fivebrane\nexists in nature and this structure survives after any proper compactification,\nthis last result can be used to test classical ``stringy'' effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 1992 21:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

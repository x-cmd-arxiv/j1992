It is found that, not just an isolated vertex operator, but also\na number of vertex operators colliding at a point can produce local charge\nnon-conservation. The structure of all such contact terms is determined. As an\napplication, I calculate all the non-vanishing bulk tachyon amplitudes directly\nthrough the Ward identities for a Virasoro subalgebra of the $w_\\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 1992 22:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

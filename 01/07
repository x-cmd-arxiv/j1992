We use these symmetries to propose massless\nfactorized S-matrices for the $su(2)$ sigma models with topological terms at\nany level, alias the $PCM_k$ models, and for the $su(2)$-coset massless flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 1992 16:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The idea was that if h is an endomorphism of B, not among the ``trivial''\nones, then there are pairwise disjoint D_n in B with h(d_n) not subset d_n.\nThen we can, for some S subset omega, add an element x such that d <= x for n\nin S, x cap d_n=0 for n not in S while forbidding a solution for {y cap\nh(d_n):n in S} cup {y cap h(d_n)=0:n not in S}.

We sketch\ntwo applications of this result, assuming 0^sharp does not exist. First, we\npoint out that this shows that any set can be coded by a real, via a set\nforcing.

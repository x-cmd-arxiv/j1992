In the bosonic case dilaton two-point functions on the sphere are\ncalculated as a stepping stone to constructing a `good' coordinate family for\ndilaton calculations on higher genus surfaces. It is found that dilaton-dilaton\ncontact terms are improperly normalized, suggesting that the interpretation of\nthe dilaton as the first variation of string coupling breaks down when other\ndilatons are present. It seems likely that this can be attributed to the\ntachyon divergence found in \\TCCT. For the heterotic case, it is found that\nthere is no tachyon divergence and that the dilaton contact terms are properly\nnormalized. Thus, a dilaton equation analogous to the one in topological\ngravity is derived and the interpretation of the dilaton as the string coupling\nconstant goes through.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 1992 20:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 1992 20:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

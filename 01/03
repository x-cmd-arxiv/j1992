In the\nlight-cone approach, superconformally transforming the light-cone\nsuper-worldsheet onto an N=(2,0) super-Riemann surface allows the elimination\nof the non-trivial interaction-point operators that complicate the evaluation\nof scattering amplitudes. In the Polyakov approach, the ten-dimensional\nheterotic Green-Schwarz covariant action defined on an N=(2,0) super-worldsheet\ncan be gauge-fixed to a free-field action with non-anomalous N=(2,0)\nsuperconformal invariance, and integrating the exponential of the covariant\naction over all punctured N=(2,0) super-Riemann surfaces produces scattering\namplitudes that closely resemble amplitudes obtained using the unitary\nlight-cone approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 1992 01:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Compactification on more general Lorentzian\nlattices (i.e. toroidal compactification in the presence of background metric,\nantisymmetric tensor, and gauge fields) yields theories for which large-small\ninvariance is not so simple. Here an equivalence is demonstrated between large\nand small geometries for all toroidal compactifications. By repeatedly\ntransforming the momentum mode corresponding to the smallest winding length to\nanother mode on the lattice, it is possible to increase the volume to exceed a\nfinite lower bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 1992 16:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

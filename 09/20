Polaronic properties due to the Jahn-Teller type effects are mainly\ndiscussed. (1) A Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type electron-phonon model is applied to\nfullerenes: C_60 and C_70, and is solved with the adiabatic approximation to\nphonons. When the system (C_60 or C_70) is doped with one or two electrons (or\nholes), the additional charges accumulate along almost an equatorial line of\nthe molecule. The dimerization becomes the weakest along the same line. Two\nenergy levels, the occupied state and the empty state, intrude largely in the\ngap. The intrusion is larger in C_70 than in C_60. These are ``polarons'' in\ndoped fullerenes. It is also found that C_60 and C_70 are related mutually with\nrespect to electronical structures as well as lattice geometries. (2) We apply\nthe model to the fullerene epoxide C_60O. It has the polaron-type lattice\ndistortion around the oxygen, and also shows the energy level intrusion in the\ngap. (3) Optical properties of C_60 are calculated and discussed. In the\nabsorption of the doped molecule, a new peak structure is present owing to the\npolaronic distortion. In the luminescence of the neutral C_60, the spacing\nbetween H_g(8)-phonon side-band peaks and the relative intensities agree well\nwith experiments. In the dispersion of the third harmonic generation, the\nmagnitudes of |chi^(3)| agree with those of experiments at the resonance of the\nlowest allowed transition as well as in the region away from the resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 1992 11:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

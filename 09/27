For special choices of\ncouplings, it reduces to a Maxwell-Higgs model with two scalar fields, a\nChern-Simons-Higgs model with two scalar fields, or other new models. We\ninvestigate the properties of the static solutions and perform detailed\nnumerical analyses. For the Chern-Simons-Higgs model with two scalar fields in\nan asymmetric phase, we prove the existence of multisoliton solutions which can\nbe viewed as hybrids of Chern-Simons vortices and $CP^1$ lumps. We also discuss\nsolutions in a symmetric phase with the help of the corresponding exact\nsolutions in its nonrelativistic limit. The model interpolating all three\nmodels---Maxwell-Higgs, Chern-Simons-Higgs, and $CP^1$ models--- is discussed\nbriefly. Finally we study the possibility of vortex solutions with half-integer\nvorticity in the special case of the model. Numerical results are negative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 1992 10:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1992 05:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

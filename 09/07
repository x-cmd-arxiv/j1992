The\ninterface tension sigma is obtained by integrating the surface energy density\nover the inverse temperature beta. We use lattices of size L x L x T, with L up\nto 64, and T up to 27. The simulations with antiperiodic boundary conditions in\nT-direction are done with the Hasenbusch-Meyer interface cluster algorithm that\nturns out to be very efficient. We demonstrate that in the rough phase the\nlarge distance behavior of the interface is well described by a massless\nGaussian dynamics. The surface stiffness coefficient kappa is determined. We\nalso attempt to determine the correlation length xi and study universal\nquantities like xi^2 * sigma and xi^2 * kappa. Results for the interfacial\nwidth on lattices up to 512 x 512 x 27 are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 1992 10:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It is conceivable that the same gauge\ngroup is also responsible for dynamical supersymmetry breaking, via gaugino and\nscalar condensation. The communication of the breaking to the observable sector\nis now mediated by ordinary gauge interactions, implying that the confining\nscale can be in the TeV-region.

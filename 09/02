To investigate Euclidean quantum gravity effects in a fundamental\nlength scenario, we simulate 4$d$ SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a dynamically\ncoupled Regge skeleton. The fluctuations of the skeleton are governed by the\nstandard Regge-Einstein action. From a small $2\\cdot 4^3$ lattice we report\nexploratory numerical results, limited to a region of strong gravity where the\nPlanck mass and hadronic masses take similar orders of magnitude. We find a\nrange of the Planck mass where stable bulk expectation values are obtained\nwhich vary smoothly with the gauge coupling, and a remnant of the QCD\ndeconfining phase transition is located.

Both dimensional regularization and\nregularization by introducing a conventional Yang-Mills component in the action\nare used. It is shown that dimensional regularization is not gauge invariant at\ntwo loops. A variant of this procedure, similar to regularization by\ndimensional reduction used in supersymmetric field theories is shown to obey\nthe Slavnov-Taylor identity to two loops and gives no renormalization of the\nChern-Simons term. Regularization with Yang-Mills term yields a finite\ninteger-valued renormalization of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term at\none loop, and we conjecture no renormalization at higher order. We also examine\nthe renormalization of Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter. We show that in\nthe non-abelian case the Chern-Simons gauge field as well as the matter fields\nrequire infinite renormalization at two loops and therefore obtain nontrivial\nanomalous dimensions.

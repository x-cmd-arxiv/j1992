First, a surface stress-energy-momentum tensor is defined by\nthe functional derivative of the action with respect to the three-metric on\n${}^3B$, the history of the system's boundary. Energy density, momentum\ndensity, and spatial stress are defined by projecting the surface stress tensor\nnormally and tangentially to a family of spacelike two-surfaces that foliate\n${}^3B$. The integral of the energy density over such a two-surface $B$ is the\nquasilocal energy associated with a spacelike three-surface $\\Sigma$ whose\nintersection with ${}^3B$ is the boundary $B$. The resulting expression for\nquasilocal energy is given in terms of the total mean curvature of the spatial\nboundary $B$ as a surface embedded in $\\Sigma$.

Bags have played an\nimportant role in models of baryons, nuclei, and more recently, in the idea\nthat a Higgs condensate may form around a very heavy top quark. It has been\nclaimed that deep bags, which correspond to tightly-bound states of fermions,\nwill form when the Yukawa coupling is strong. Quantum corrections, however, are\nsignificant in this regime. We examine the effects of these quantum corrections\non the formation of nontopological solitons in an exactly solvable large-$N$\nmodel. We find that quantum bags differ dramatically from those of the\nclassical theory. In particular, for large Yukawa coupling, the bags remain\nshallow and the fermions weakly bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 1992 22:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In the nonabelian sector there exist a\ncountable family of globally regular solutions which are purely magnetic but\nhave zero Yang-Mills magnetic charge. Their discrete spectrum of energies is\nbounded from above by the energy of the abelian magnetic monopole with unit\nmagnetic charge. The stability analysis demonstrates that the solutions are\nsaddle points of the energy functional with increasing number of unstable\nmodes. The existence and instability of these solutions are \"explained\" by the\nMorse-theory argument recently proposed by Sudarsky and Wald.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 1992 07:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

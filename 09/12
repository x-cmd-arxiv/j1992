Here we model this emission by calculating numerical\nhydrodynamic simulations of the starburst event to much later times and larger\nscales than previously considered. For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of\n0.1 ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to\nthe galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble\nand the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform\ndensity disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \\alt $ 3.6 Myr);\nbreakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6\n  Myr $\\alt t \\alt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more\nspherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\\alt t$). For a halo density\nof $10^{-3} {\\rm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from\nthe center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr. We calculate the time evolution\nof the X-ray luminosity and find that the extended starburst emits $3\\times\n10^{39}\\lcgs$ to $10^{40}\\lcgs$ in the\n  GINGA LAC band and $\\sim 10^{41}\\lcgs$ in the Einstein or ROSAT\n  HRI band.

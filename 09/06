This framework\nhas the virtue of providing a large subspace of the configuration space of the\nheterotic string, probing its structure far beyond the present reaches of\nsolvable models. The construction proceeds in two stages: First all\nsingularities/catastrophes which lead to ground states of the heterotic string\nare found. It is then shown that not all ground states described in this way\nare independent but that certain classes of these LG/CY string vacua can be\nrelated to other, simpler, theories via a process involving fractional\ntransformations of the order parameters as well as orbifolding. This\nconstruction has far reaching consequences. Firstly it allows for a systematic\nidentification of mirror pairs that appear abundantly in this class of string\nvacua, thereby showing that the emerging mirror symmetry is not accidental.\nThis is important because models with mirror flipped spectra are a priori\nindependent theories, described by distinct CY/LG models. It also shows that\nmirror symmetry is not restricted to the space of string vacua described by\ntheories based on Fermat potentials (corresponding to minimal tensor models).\nFurthermore it shows the need for a better set of coordinates of the\nconfiguration space or else the structure of this space will remain obscure.\nWhile the space of LG vacua is {\\it not} completely mirror symmetric, results\ndescribed in the last part suggest that the space of Landau--Ginburg {\\it\norbifolds} possesses this symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 1992 10:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

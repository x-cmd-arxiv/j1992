Highly irregular\ntwo-dimensional dentritic islands of Au particles that gradually grow on a\nlarger host lattice of Ru particles and have fractal dimension d_{f}~ 1.70\neach, are generated via a multiple had-hoc version of the DLA algorithm for\nsingle aggregates. Annealing effects on the islands morphology are reproduced\nassuming different sticking probabilities at nearest-neighbour lattice sites of\nAu films on Ru(001). Using simulation data, islands growth are described in\nanalogy to diffusion-limited, precipitate growth with soft impingement of\nprecipities. This leads to analyse thin film island growth kinetics in such\nfractal systems and to predict a main peak in scattering intensity patterns due\nto interisland interference. ----------------\n  Copies upon request to: canessae@itsictp.bitnet\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 1992 07:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

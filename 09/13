In the light of\nthe new results from COBE, we examine in detail here cold dark matter\ncosmogonies based on inflationary models predicting power-law spectra. Along\nwith power-law and extended inflation, this class includes natural inflation.\nThe latter is of interest because, unlike the first two, it produces a\npower-law spectrum without significant gravitational wave production. We\nexamine a range of phenomena, including large angle microwave background\nfluctuations, clustering in the galaxy distribution, bulk peculiar velocity\nflows, the formation of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure\nformation. Of the three models, only natural inflation seems capable of\nexplaining the large scale clustering of optical galaxies. Such a model, though\nat best marginal even at present, has some advantages over standard CDM and on\nmost grounds appears to perform at least as well. Power-law inflation's primary\ninterest may ultimately only be in permitting a larger bias parameter than\nstandard CDM; it appears unable to explain excess clustering. Most models of\nextended inflation are ruled out at a high confidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 1992 11:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

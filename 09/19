Unfortunately, such exact diagonalization methods are\nrestricted to small system sizes. We show that if the Hubbard $U$ term is\nreplaced by a ``periodic Hubbard\" term, the full many body Hamiltonian may be\nnumerically exactly solved, even for very large systems (even $>$100 sites),\nthough only for low fillings. However, for half-filled systems and large $U$\nthis approach is not only no longer exact, it no longer improves extrapolation\nto larger systems. We discuss how generalized ``randomized variable averaging''\n(RVA) or ``phase randomization'' schemes can be reliably employed to improve\nextrapolation to large system sizes in this regime. This general approach can\nbe combined with any many-body method and is thus of broad interest and\napplicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 1992 00:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Doping\ninto such phases or near the phase boundaries can lead to further interesting\nphenomena such as separation of spin and charge, a dopant-induced phase\ntransition of the global (parent) phase, or real-space (``bipolaronic'')\npairing.

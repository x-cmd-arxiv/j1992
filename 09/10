The treatment of Connes\nis modified in such a way that the basic algebra is defined over the space of\nmatrices, and the breaking mechanism is planted in the Dirac operator. This\nmechanism is then applied to three examples. In the first example the discrete\nspace consists of two points, and the two algebras are taken respectively to be\nthose of $2\\times 2$ and $1\\times 1$ matrices. With the Dirac operator\ncontaining the vacuum breaking $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ to $U(1)$, the model is shown\nto correspond to the standard model. In the second example the discrete space\nhas three points, two of the algebras are identical and consist of $5\\times 5$\ncomplex matrices, and the third algebra consists of functions. With an\nappropriate Dirac operator this model is almost identical to the minimal\n$SU(5)$ model of Georgi and Glashow.

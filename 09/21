Instead, it has been proposed that\nthroughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken\nphases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the\ncase. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous\nstate of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 1992 18:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

An approach to understanding\nelectric charge quantization that can be used for gauge theories with explicit\n$U(1)$ factors -- such as the standard model and its variants -- is\npedagogically reviewed and discussed in this article. This approach uses the\nallowed invariances of the Lagrangian and their associated anomaly cancellation\nequations. We demonstrate that charge may be de-quantized in the\nthree-generation standard model with massless neutrinos, because differences in\nfamily-lepton--numbers are anomaly-free. We also review the relevant\nexperimental limits. Our approach to charge quantization suggests that the\nminimal standard model should be extended so that family-lepton--number\ndifferences are explicitly broken. We briefly discuss some candidate extensions\n(e.g. the minimal standard model augmented by Majorana right-handed neutrinos).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 1992 23:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

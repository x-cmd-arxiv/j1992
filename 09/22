The chiral Lagrangians for the electromagnetic interactions of heavy\nhadrons consist of two pieces: one from gauging electromagnetically the\nstrong-interaction chiral Lagrangian, and the other from the anomalous magnetic\nmoment interactions of the heavy baryons and mesons. Due to the heavy quark\nspin symmetry, the latter contains only one independent coupling constant in\nthe meson sector and two in the baryon sector. These coupling constants only\ndepend on the light quarks and can be calculated in the nonrelativistic quark\nmodel. However, the charm quark is not heavy enough and the contribution from\nits magnetic moment must be included.

The spontaneous breakdown of the vacuum state\ngenerates an external time and the wave function of the Universe satisfies a\ntime dependent Schrodinger equation, which reduces to the Wheeler-deWitt\nequation in the classical regime for $T < T_c$, allowing a semi-classical WKB\napproximation to the wave function. The conservation of energy is spontaneously\nviolated for $T > T_c$ and matter is created fractions of seconds after the big\nbang, generating the matter in the Universe. The time direction of the vacuum\nexpectation value of the scalar Higgs field generates a time asymmetry, which\ndefines the cosmological arrow of time and the direction of increasing entropy\nas the Lorentz symmetry is restored at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 1992 22:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

We give an example of a first order theory $T$ with countable $D(T)$\nwhich cannot have a universal model at $\\aleph_1$ without CH; we prove in $ZFC$\na covering theorem from the hypothesis of the existence of a universal model\nfor some theory; and we prove --- again in ZFC --- that for a large class of\ncardinals there is no universal linear order (e.g. in every\n$\\aleph_1<\\l<2^{\\aleph_0}$). In fact, what we show is that if there is a\nuniversal linear order at a regular $\\l$ and its existence is not a result of a\ntrivial cardinal arithmetical reason, then $\\l$ ``resembles'' $\\aleph_1$ --- a\ncardinal for which the consistency of having a universal order is known. As for\nsingular cardinals, we show that for many singular cardinals, if they are not\nstrong limits then they have no universal linear order. As a result of the non\nexistence of a universal linear order, we show the non-existence of universal\nmodels for all theories possessing the strict order property (for example,\nordered fields and groups, Boolean algebras, p-adic rings and fields, partial\norders, models of PA and so on).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

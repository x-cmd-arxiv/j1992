Using instead ``renormalized'' coupling constants defined in terms\nof physical quantities, like the heavy-quark potential, greatly enhances the\npredictive power of lattice perturbation theory. The quality of these\npredictions is further enhanced by a method for automatically determining the\ncoupling-constant scale most appropriate to a particular quantity. We present a\nmean-field analysis that explains the large renormalizations relating lattice\nquantities, like the coupling constant, to their continuum analogues. This\nsuggests a new prescription for designing lattice operators that are more\ncontinuum-like than conventional operators. Finally, we provide evidence that\nthe scaling of physical quantities is asymptotic or perturbative already at\n$\\beta$'s as low as 5.7, provided the evolution from scale to scale is analyzed\nusing renormalized perturbation theory. This result indicates that reliable\nsimulations of (quenched) QCD are possible at these same low $\\beta$'s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 1992 17:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

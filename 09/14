We restrict the\nperturbative QCD resummation to the large transverse momentum region, and use a\nsimple Regge-pole parametrization in the infrared region. This picture allows\nus to account for existing data, and to estimate the size of the perturbative\ncontribution to future diffractive measurements. At LHC and SSC energies, we\nfind that a cut-off BFKL equation can lead to a measurable perturbative\ncomponent in traditionally soft processes.

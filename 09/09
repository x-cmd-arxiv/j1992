Many such\nanalyses give far too stringent bounds. This is independent of questions of\ngauge invariance, contrary to the recent claims of de Rujula et. al., since the\nlagrangians used in these calculations ARE gauge invariant, but the SU(2)_L X\nU(1)_Y symmetry is nonlinearly realized. The real source of the problem is the\nincorrect use of cutoffs -- the cutoff dependence of a loop integral does not\nnecessarily reflect the true dependence on the heavy physics scale M. If done\ncarefully, one finds that the constraints on anomalous TGC's are much weaker.\nWe also compare effective lagrangians in which SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y is realized\nlinearly and nonlinearly, and discuss the role of custodial SU(2) in each\nformulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 1992 15:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We show that these dressings can be\nobtained by applying the methods of David and Distler and Kawai. We consider\ntwo extreme limits. In the first limit the string tension is large and the\ndynamics is dominated by the Nambu-Goto term. We analyze this theory around a\nclassical solution in the situation where the length scale of the solution is\nlarge compared to the length scale set by the string tension. Couplings get\ndressed by the liouville mode (which is now a composite field) in a non-trivial\nfashion. However this does {\\it not} imply that the excitations around a\nphysical ``long string\" have a phase space corresponding to an extra dimension.\nIn the second limit the string tension is small and the dynamics is governed by\nthe extrinsic curvature term. We show, perturbatively, that in this theory the\nrelationship between the induced metric and the worldsheet metric is\n``renormalized\", while the extrinsic curvature term receives a non-trivial\ndressing as well. This has the consequence that in a generic situation the\ndependence of couplings on the physical scale is different from that predicted\nby their beta functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 1992 20:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The phase\ndiagrams of the Blume-Capel model are classified, and the existence of a\nsurface first order transition is discussed. This transition is shown to be,\nunder certain conditions, slightly reentrant, and the behavior of the surface\norder parameters and correlation functions is given for such a case.

Hydrogen adsorption on a W(100) surface causes a switching\ntransition in the symmetry of the displacements of the W atoms within the\nordered c(2x2) phase. This transition is modeled by an effective Hamiltonian,\nwhere the hydrogen degrees of freedom are integrated out. Based on extensive\nMonte Carlo renormalisation group calculations we show that the switching\ntransition is of second order at high temperatures and of first order at low\ntemperatures. This behavior is qualitatively explained in terms of an XY model\nwhere there is an interplay between four and eight fold anisotropy fields. We\nalso compare the calculated phase diagrams with a simple mean field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1992 07:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

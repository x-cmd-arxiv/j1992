The matrix elements and the\nselection rules for both the single photon (emission - absorption) and two\nphoton (Raman scattering) processes are obtained. The results reveal striking\nasymmetries: light absorption by quasiparticle pair creation or single\nquasiparticle scattering can occur only if the handedness of the incident\nradiation is opposite to that of the vortex core states. We show how these\neffects will lead to nonreciprocal circular birefringence, and also predict\nstructure in the frequency dependence of conductivity and in the differential\ncross section of the Raman scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1992 17:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

This no-go result applies in\nparticular to the old unified theory of Einstein and its recent avatars.\nHowever, we find that the addition of nonderivative, ``cosmological'' terms\nformally restores consistency by giving a mass to the antisymmetric tensor\nfield, thereby transmuting it into a fifth-force-like massive vector but with\nnovel possible matter couplings.

The Poisson bracket algebra of the alternative constraints closes in\nthe non-degenerate sector, with structure functions that involve the {\\it\ninverse} of the spatial triad. Thus, the algebra does {\\it not} close in the\ndegenerate sector.

All of the constraints taken\ntogether are implied by, but do not imply, Ashtekar's original form of\nconstraints. Thus, the alternative constraints give rise to a different\ndegenerate extension of GR.

At each of these values of kappa we have carried out spectrum\ncalculations on 12^3x24 lattices for two values of the gauge coupling in the\nvicinity of the crossover in order to set an energy scale for our\nthermodynamics calculations and to determine the critical value of the gauge\ncoupling for which the pion and quark masses vanish. For kappa=0.17 and 0.18 we\nfind coexistence between the high and low temperature regimes over 1,000\nsimulation time units indicating either that the equilibration time is\nextremely long or that there is a possibility of a first order phase\ntransition.

We perfomed numerical\nsimulations at N=4 and N=10. In order to test the universality, we adopted two\ndifferent lattice formulations. Scaling and universality tests led to the\nconclusion that at N=10 the geometrical approach gives a good definition of\nlattice topological susceptibility. On the other hand, N=4 proved not to be\nlarge enough to suppress the unphysical configurations, called dislocations,\ncontributing to the topological susceptibility. We obtained other\ndeterminations of the topological susceptibility by the field theoretical\nmethod, wich relies on a local definition of the lattice topological charge\ndensity, and the cooling method. They gave quite consistent results, showing\nscaling and universality. The large-N expansion predicts an exponential area\nlaw behavior for sufficiently large Wilson loops, which implies confinement,\ndue to the dynamical matter fields and absence of the screening phenomenon. We\ndetermined the string tension, without finding evidence of screening effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 1992 08:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

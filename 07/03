This new approximation plays the role of the mean-field theory for\nsuch processes and is valid over a significantly larger range than an earlier\nvariant, which was based on a mapping to chemical reactions. In particular,\ncontinuum-limit off-lattice deposition is described naturally within our\napproximation. The criteria for the applicability of the mean-field theory are\nderived. While deposition of dimers, and marginally, trimers, is affected by\nfluctuations, we find that the k-mer deposition kinetics is asymptotically\nmean-field like for all k=4,5,..., where the limit k->infinity, when properly\ndefined, describes deposition-diffusion kinetics in the continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 1992 10:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

(2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\noscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\nthe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\nnon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\ninto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\nadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\nangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\ncorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\nnon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\ntemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\nprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\nbroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\nSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\nintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs.

For $M_{Z'}\\simeq1$ TeV it would allow determination of\ncombinations of $Z'$ gauge couplings to the quarks to around 10 percent. An\nanalysis of the extraction of gauge couplings from the complementary tests:\nforward-backward asymmetry, rare decays $pp\\to V'\\to f_1{\\bar f_2}V$, and the\nproduction cross section $pp\\to V'V$ is given in a model-independent framework.\nFour ratios of charges are needed to characterize a general gauge theory with\nan additional family-independent $U_1'$ factor. We show that there are four\nfunctions of these ratios observable at hadron colliders, but for projected SSC\nand LHC luminosities only two combinations can be extracted. These yield a\nsignificant discrimination between interesting GUT-motivated models. Clean\ntests of whether a new $W'$ couples to right-handed currents, of the ratio\n$g_R/g_L$ of gauge couplings, and of the non-abelian vertex in left-right\nsymmetric models are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 1992 20:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

The morphology of the deposit both near the surface and in the\nbulk seems to be a result of competition of screening and branching; nearly\nhalf of all the spheres are either single-contact dangling ends, or branching\nnodes with more than two contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 1992 12:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

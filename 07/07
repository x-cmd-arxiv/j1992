First it was discovered that moduli spaces of toroidal compactification\nare given by noncompact groups modded out by their maximal compact subgroups\nand discrete duality groups. Then it was found that many other moduli spaces\nhave analogous descriptions. More recently, noncompact group symmetries have\nturned up in effective actions used to study string cosmology and other\nclassical configurations. This paper explores these noncompact groups in the\ncase of toroidal compactification both from the viewpoint of low-energy\neffective field theory, using the method of dimensional reduction, and from the\nviewpoint of the string theory world sheet. The conclusion is that all these\nsymmetries are intimately related.

We start with a description of the ``abelian bosonization\".\nThe methods of the abelian bosonization are applied to several examples like\nthe Thirring model, the Schwinger model and QCD$_2$. The failure of this scheme\nto handle flavored fermions is explained. Witten's non-abelian bosonization\nrules are summarized including the generalization to the case of fermions with\ncolor and flavor degrees of freedom. We discuss in details the bosonic version\nof the mass bilinear of colored-flavored fermions in various schemes. The color\ngroup is gauged and the full bosonized version of massive multiflavor QCD is\nwritten down. The strong coupling limit is taken in the ``product scheme\" and\nthen in the $U(N_F\\times N_C)$ scheme. Once the multiflavor $QCD_2$ action in\nthe interesting region of the low energies is written down, we extract the\nsemiclassical low lying baryonic spectrum. First classical soliton solutions of\nthe bosonic action are derived. Quantizing the flavor space around those\nclassical solutions produces the masses as well as the flavor properties of the\ntwo dimensional baryons. In addition low lying multibaryonic solutions are\npresented, as well as wave functions and matrix elements of interest, like\n$q\\bar q$ content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 1992 10:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

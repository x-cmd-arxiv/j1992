The Hall conductivity calculated from this current agrees with\nother mean-field calculations which assume a uniform applied electric field\n(the Schmid-Caroli-Maki solution), thereby vindicating these simplified\ntreatments. We then use these results to calculate the transverse\nthermomagnetic effects (the Ettingshausen and Nernst effects).

Using a method due to Gor'kov and\nKopnin, we derive an equation of motion for a single vortex ($B\\ll H_{c2}$) in\nthe presence of an applied transport current. The imaginary part of the\nrelaxation time and the normal state Hall effect both break ``particle-hole\nsymmetry,'' and produce a component of the vortex velocity parallel to the\ntransport current, and consequently a Hall field due to the vortex motion.\nVarious models for the relaxation time are considered, allowing for a\ncomparison to some phenomenological models of vortex motion in superconductors,\nsuch as the Bardeen-Stephen and Nozi\\`eres-Vinen models, as well as to models\nof vortex motion in neutral superfluids. In addition, the transport energy,\nNernst effect, and thermopower are calculated for a single vortex. Vortex\nbending and fluctuations can also be included within this description,\nresulting in a Langevin equation description of the vortex motion. The Langevin\nequation is used to discuss the propagation of helicon waves and the\ndiffusional motion of a vortex line. The results are discussed in light of the\nrather puzzling sign change of the Hall effect which has been observed in the\nmixed state of the high temperature superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 1992 21:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

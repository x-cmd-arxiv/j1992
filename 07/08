The use of the toroidal topology enables us to enforce\nthe non-zero external extension without the necessity of defining a boundary\nand allows us to measure directly the string tension. We show that a phase\ntransition from the crumpled phase to the smooth phase observed earlier for a\nspherical topology appears also for a toroidal surface for the same finite\nvalue of the coupling constant of the extrinsic curvature term. The phase\ntransition is characterized by the vanishing of the string tension. We discuss\nthe possible non-trivial continuum limit of the theory, when approaching the\ncritical point. Numerically we find a value of the critical exponent $\\n$ to be\nbetween .38 and .42. The specific heat, related to the extrinsic curvature term\nseems not to diverge (or diverge slower than logarithmically) at the critical\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 1992 13:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We present a\nrevision of the analysis of sphaleron baryon-number violating processes in the\nstandard model including lepton-mass effects. We find the surprising result\nthat a GUT-scale matter-asymmetry can survive the $B$ and $L$ violating\nsphaleron interactions even though ($B- L$) is conserved and equals zero for\nall temperatures. We extend the analysis to cover the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (MSSM) and also derive the constraints on the R-parity violating\ncouplings in extensions of the MSSM. In the case of the baryon number violating\ndimension 4 operators we find, contrary to current wisdom, that the resulting\nbounds can be avoided completely because of a residual lepton-flavour number\nconservation; in the case of lepton number violating operators we find the\nbounds are flavour dependent and can be avoided completely in definite flavour\nchannels. We also consider how the bounds are modified in the case there is a\nGrand Unified extension of the supersymmetric model which introduces new lepton\nflavour violating couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

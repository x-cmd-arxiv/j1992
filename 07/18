At the leading order of a fermionic hopping parameter\nexpansion we find that the fermion-gauge coupling has a chiral and tree-like\nstructure. We argue that this fermion-gauge coupling remains non-zero in the\ncontinuum limit taken in the Higgs phase. Possible fermion-scalar couplings in\nthis approach are considered. We also evaluate the fermion interaction with an\nexternal gauge field in the slightly modified model and show that it has a\nchiral structure in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 1992 04:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

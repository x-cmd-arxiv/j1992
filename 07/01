Especially, we will discuss about the global\ntopological structure in the relevant gauge orbit spaces to be clarified. As it\nis shown that in non-abelian gauge theories with a $\\theta$ term, the induced\ngauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge functions restricted on the\nspace boundary $S^2$ has a magnetic monopole structure and the gauge orbit\nspace has a vortex structure if there is a magnetic monopole in the ordinary\nspace. The Dirac's quantization conditions in the quantum theories ensure that\nthe vacuum angle $\\theta$ in the gauge theories must be quantized. The\nquantization rule is given by $\\theta=2\\pi/n~(n\\neq 0)$ with n being the\ntopological charge of the magnetic monopole. Therefore, the strong CP problem\nis automatically solved in the presence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\\pm\n1$ with $\\theta=\\pm 2\\pi$, or magnetic monopoles of very large total\ntopological charge ($|n|\\geq 10^92\\pi$) if it is consistent with the abundance\nof magnetic monopoles. Where in the first case with a magnetic monopole of\ntopological charge 1 or -1, we mean the strong CP-violation can be only very\nsmall by the measurements implemented so far. Since $\\theta=\\pm 2\\pi$\ncorrespond to different monopole sectors, the CP can not be conserved exactly\nin strong interactions in this case. In the second case, the strong CP cannot\nbe conserved either for large but finite n. The fact that the strong\nCP-violation measured so far can be only so small or vanishing may be a signal\nfor the existence of magnetic monopoles.

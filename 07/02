The\ngrowth mechanism involves interface hopping and pairwise annihilation\nsupplemented by spontaneous creation of the stable-phase, +1, regions by\noverturning the unstable-phase, -1, spins with probability p. For cluster\ncoarsening at phase coexistence, p=0, the conventional structure-factor scaling\napplies. In this limit our model falls in the class of diffusion-limited\nreactions A+A->inert. The +1 cluster size grows diffusively, ~t**(1/2), and the\ntwo-point correlation function obeys scaling. However, for p>0, i.e., for the\ndynamics of formation of stable phase from unstable phase, we find that\nstructure-factor scaling breaks down; the length scale associated with the size\nof the growing +1 clusters reflects only the short-distance properties of the\ntwo-point correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 1992 14:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

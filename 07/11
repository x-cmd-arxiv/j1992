Solving the latter with\nquantum Monte Carlo procedures enables us to obtain exact results for the one\nand two-particle properties of the infinite dimensional Hubbard model. In\nparticular we find antiferromagnetism and a pseudogap in the single-particle\ndensity of states for sufficiently large values of the intrasite Coulomb\ninteraction at half filling. Both the antiferromagnetic phase and the\ninsulating phase above the N\\'eel temperature are found to be quickly\nsuppressed on doping. The latter is replaced by a heavy electron metal with a\nquasiparticle mass strongly dependent on doping as soon as $n<1$. At half\nfilling the antiferromagnetic phase boundary agrees surprisingly well in shape\nand order of magnitude with results for the three dimensional Hubbard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 1992 19:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 1992 14:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Our analysis includes\neffects of all Yukawa couplings of third generation fermions, and allows for a\nfairly general set of soft SUSY breaking parameters at the Planck scale. We\nfind that a cosmologically interesting relic density emerges naturally over\nwide regions of parameter space. However, the requirement that relic\nneutralinos do not overclose the universe does not lead to upper bounds on SUSY\nbreaking parameters that are strictly valid for all combinations of parameters\nand of interest for existing or planned collider experiments; in particular,\ngluino and squark masses in excess of 5 TeV cannot strictly be excluded. On the\nother hand, in the ``generic'' case of a gaugino--like neutralino whose\nannihilation cross sections are not ``accidentally'' enhanced by a nearby Higgs\nor $Z$ pole, all sparticles should lie within the reach of the proposed $pp$\nand $e^+e^-$ supercolliders.

In this paper we address the question whether, given a smooth\ncomplex Finsler metric on a complex manifold, it is possible to give purely\ndifferential geometric properties of the metric ensuring the existence of such\na fibration in complex geodesics of the manifold. We first discuss at some\nlength the notion of holomorphic sectional curvature for a complex Finsler\nmetric; then, using the differential equation of complex geodesics we obtained\nin a previous paper, we show that for every pair (point, tangent vector) there\nis a (only a segment if the metric is not complete) complex geodesic passing\nthrough the point tangent to the given vector iff the Finsler metric is\nK\\\"ahler, has constant holomorphic sectional curvature -4 and satisfies a\nsimmetry condition on the curvature tensor. Finally, we show that a complex\nFinsler metric of constant holomorphic sectional curvature -4 satisfying the\ngiven simmetry condition on the curvature is necessarily the Kobayashi metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 1992 21:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The first question is: what analytic\nproperties does the cluster inherit from varieties? We give a sufficient\ncriterion when the cluster contains an analytic disk, but it follows from\nexamples of Stolzenberg and Wermer that, in general, clusters can contain no\nanalytic disks. So we study algebras of continuous function on clusters, which\ncan be approximated by holomorphic functions or polynomials, and show that this\nalgebras possess some analytic properties in all but explicitly pathological\nand uninteresting cases. Secondly, we apply and results about clusters to\npolynomial hulls and maximal functions, finding remnants of analytic structures\nthere too. And, finally, due to more and more frequent appearances of analytic\ndisks as tools in complex analysis, it seems to be interesting to look at their\nsequences to establish terminology, basic notation and properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 1992 21:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

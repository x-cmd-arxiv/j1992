Using the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice\nHamiltonian with relaxational dynamics, the polarization and linear response\nare calculated numerically. ... On the irreversible approach to threshold, the\nresponse due to avalanches triggered by local instabilities dominates the\npolarizability, which diverges in one and two dimensions. Characteristic\ndiverging length scales are studied using finite-size scaling of the\nsample-to-sample variations of the threshold field in finite systems and\nfinite-size effects in the linear polarizability and the irreversible\npolarization. A dominant diverging correlation length is found which controls\nthe threshold field distribution, finite-size effects in the irreversible\npolarization, and a cutoff size for the avalanche size distribution. Our\nresults are compared with those for related models and questions are raised\nconcerning the relationship of the static critical behavior below threshold to\nthe dynamic critical behavior in the sliding state above threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 1992 15:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The fundamental modular domain,\nwhich represents a one-to-one representation of the set of gauge invariant\ndegrees of freedom, is a bounded convex subset of the trans- verse gauge\nfields. Boundary identifications are the only remnants of the Gribov copies,\nand carry all the information about the topology of the Yang-Mills\nconfiguration space. Conversely, the known topology can be shown to imply that\n(on a set of measure zero on the boundary) some points of the boundary coincide\nwith the Gribov horizon. For the low-lying energies, wavefunctionals can be\nshown to spread out \"across\" certain parts of these boundaries. This is how the\ntopology of Yang-Mills configuration space has an essential influence on the\nlow-lying spectrum, in a situation where these non- perturbative effects are\nnot exponentially suppressed.\n  This write-up is a short summary, with adequate references, where details on\nmost of the material I have presented can be found.

In\norder to study whether the failure of the KO mechanism is particular only to\nthe Abelian gauge or whether this failure occurs in a wide class of gauges\nincluding the ordinary Lorentz type gauge, we carry out a renormalization group\nstudy of the $SU(2)$ gauge theory in the gauge fixing space. Our gauge fixing\nspace consists of four distinct regions that are not connected with each other\nby renormalization group flows, and we find that the Abelian gauge is {\\it\ninfrared unstable} in three regions which include the Lorentz type gauge. This\nsuggests that the failure of the KO mechanism is a phenomenon which occurs only\nin the Abelian gauge. We also find that the Lorentz gauge is infrared stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 1992 05:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The weak perturbation theory of transverse lattice non-compact QED is\ndeveloped in light-cone gauge, and we argue that for fixed lattice spacing this\ntheory is ultraviolet finite, order by order in perturbation theory. However,\nby calculating the anomalous scaling dimension of the link fields, we find that\nthe interaction Hamiltonian becomes non-renormalizable for $g^2(a) > 4\\pi$,\nwhere $g(a)$ is the bare (lattice) QED coupling constant. We conjecture that\nthis is the critical point of the chiral symmetry breaking phase transition in\nQED. Non-perturbative chiral symmetry breaking is then studied in the strong\ncoupling limit. The discrete remnant of chiral symmetry that remains on the\nlattice is spontaneously broken, and the ground state to lowest order in the\nstrong coupling expansion corresponds to the classical ground state of the\ntwo-dimensional spin one-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 1992 19:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

They are an\nexpanded version of lectures given in Stony Brook in Spring 1992. I am indebted\nto help from the audience.\n  Section 1 describes unpublished work by J.-C. Yoccoz on local connectivity of\nquadratic Julia sets. It presents only the \"easy\" part of his work, in the\nsense that it considers only non-renormalizable polynomials, and makes no\neffort to describe the much more difficult arguments which are needed to deal\nwith local connectivity in parameter space. It is based on second hand sources,\nnamely Hubbard together with lectures by Branner and Douady. Hence the\npresentation is surely quite different from that of Yoccoz.\n  Section 2 describes the analogous arguments used by Branner and Hubbard to\nstudy higher degree polynomials for which all but one of the critical orbits\nescape to infinity. In this case, the associated Julia set J is never locally\nconnected. The basic problem is rather to decide when J is totally\ndisconnected. This Branner-Hubbard work came before Yoccoz, and its technical\ndetails are not as difficult. However, in these notes their work is presented\nsimply as another application of the same geometric ideas.\n  Chapter 3 complements the Yoccoz results by describing a family of examples,\ndue to Douady and Hubbard (unpublished), showing that an infinitely\nrenormalizable quadratic polynomial may have non-locally-connected Julia set.\nAn Appendix describes needed tools from complex analysis, including the\nGr\\\"otzsch inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

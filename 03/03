We reformulate the\ndepth rule in a precise way, and show how, in principle, it can be used to\ncalculate fusion coefficients. However, we argue that the computation of the\ndepth itself, in terms of which the constraints on tensor product coefficients\nis formulated, is problematic. Indeed, the elements of the basis of states\nconvenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have a\nwell-defined depth! We proceed by showing how one can calculate the depth in an\n`approximate' way and derive accurate lower bounds for the minimum level at\nwhich a coupling appears. It turns out that this method yields exact results\nfor $\\widehat{su}(3)$ and constitutes an efficient and simple algorithm for\ncomputing $\\widehat{su}(3)$ fusion coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 1992 18:43:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1992 19:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We discuss how the space-time metric is introduced from\nalgebraic relations of the constraints and the Hamiltonian by focusing our\nattention on the signature factor. The system describes both Euclidian and\nLorentzian metrics depending on reality assignments of the gauge connections.\nThat is, Euclidian metrics arise from the real gauge fields. On the other hand,\nself-duality of the gauge fields, which is well known in the Ashtekar's\nformalism, is also derived in this theory from consistency condition of\nLorentzian metric.

In our two dimensional models, self-affine surfaces may only\nappear when the roughness exponent is $\\chi = 1/2$ or $\\chi = 1$. A new scaling\npicture, which leads to more suitable ways of determining the scaling\nexponents, is proposed when lack of self-affinity exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 1992 09:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

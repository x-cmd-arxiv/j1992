We take this new physics to be extended color. Our models\ncontain new particles with masses between 100 GeV and 1 TeV, some of which may\nbe just within the reach of the next generation of experiments. In particular\none of our models implies the existence of two right handed top quarks. These\nmodels demonstrate the existence of a standard model-like theory consistent\nwith experiment, and leading to new physics below the TeV scale, in which the\nthird generation is treated differently than the first two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 1992 18:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

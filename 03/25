This is analogous to the van Kampen procedure\nfor finding a fundamental group of a plane curve. In addition we use a certain\nrepresentation generalizing the Burau representation of the braid group. A\ndivisibility theorem is proven that shows the dependence of this homotopy group\non the local type of singularities and behavior at infinity. Examples are given\nshowing that this group depends on certain global data in addition to local\ndata on singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 1992 21:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Where appropriate, the two--photon processes are compared with\nannihilation reactions leading to similar final states. We also argue that the\nbehaviour of the total inelastic gamma-gamma cross section at high energies\nwill probably have little impact on the severity of background problems caused\nby soft and semi--hard (`minijet') two--photon reactions.

A gauge-fixing term is used which generates a\ncanonical momentum for $A_0$, so that there are no primary constraints on\noperator-valued fields. Gauss's Law and the gauge condition, $A_0=0$, are\nimplemented by embedding the formulation in an appropriate physical subspace,\nin which state vectors remain naturally, in the course of time evolution. The\nphoton propagator is derived from the canonical theory. The electric and\nmagnetic fields are separated into parts that reflect the presence of massive\nphotons, and other parts that are rigidly attached to charged fermions and do\nnot consist of any observable, propagating particle excitations. The effect of\nrotations on charged particle states is analyzed, and the relation between the\ncanonical and the Belinfante ``symmetric'' angular momentum is discussed. It is\nshown that the rotation operator can be consistently formulated so that charged\nparticles behave like fermions, and do not acquire any arbitrary phases during\nrotations, even when they are dressed in the electromagnetic fields required\nfor them to obey Gauss's law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 1992 21:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The dense phase is reconsidered, with special attention paid to\nthe topological points $g=1/p$. This phase is complementary to the dilute and\nhigher multicritical phases in the sense that dense models contain the same\nspectrum of bulk operators (found in the continuum by Lian and Zuckerman) but a\ndifferent set of boundary operators. This difference illuminates the well-known\n$(p,q)$ asymmetry of the matrix chain models. Higher multicritical phases are\nconstructed, generalizing both Kazakov's multicritical models as well as the\nknown dilute phase models. They are quite likely related to multicritical\npolymer theories recently considered independently by Saleur and Zamolodchikov.\nOur results may be of help in defining such models on {\\it flat} honeycomb\nlattices; an unsolved problem in polymer theory. The phase boundaries\ncorrespond again to ``topological'' points with $g=p/1$ integer, which we study\nin some detail. Two qualitatively different types of critical points are\ndiscovered for each such $g$. For the special point $g=2$ we demonstrate that\nthe dilute phase $O(-2)$ model does {\\it not} correspond to the Parisi-Sourlas\nmodel, a result likely to hold as well for the flat case.

The high--temperature expansion follows in a sistematic and\nrelatively simple way. For low temperatures we obtain the correct central\ncharge and predict the analytic structure of the full expansion around $T=0$.\nFurthermore, we derive a single non-linear integral equation describing the\nfinite--size ground--state energy of the Sine--Gordon quantum field theory.\nPACS: 05.30, 03.70. 75.10.5\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 1992 14:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 1992 15:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

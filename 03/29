We assume a\nrelatively heavy supersymmetric particle spectrum, and include recent results\non one-loop radiative corrections to Higgs-boson masses and couplings. We begin\nby discussing present and future constraints from the LEP experiments. We then\ncompute branching ratios and total widths for the neutral ($h,H,A$) and charged\n($H^\\pm$) Higgs particles. We present total cross-sections and event rates for\nthe important discovery channels at the LHC and SSC. Promising physics\nsignatures are given by $h \\to \\gamma \\gamma$, $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ or $Z^*\nZ^*$ or $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$, $A \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$, and $t \\to b H^+$ followed by\n$H^+ \\to \\tau^+ \\nu_{\\tau}$, which should allow for an almost complete coverage\nof the parameter space of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 1992 14:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We find a\nnonperturbative expression for the partition function as a function of the\ncosmological constant, the SG mass and the SG coupling constant. At genus zero,\nthe partition function exhibits singularities which are interpreted as signals\nof phase transitions. A semiclassical picture of one of these transitions is\nproposed. According to this picture, a phase in which the Sine-Gordon field and\nthe geometry are frozen melts into another phase in which the fields and\ngeometry become dynamical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 1992 20:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We prove that, in fact, the general Lorentz-invariant and $U(1)_\\em$\ninvariant but {\\it not} $SU_L(2)\\times U_Y(1)$ invariant action is equivalent\nto the general lagrangian in which $SU_L(2)\\times U_Y(1)$ appears but is\nnonlinearly realized. We demonstrate this equivalence in an explicit\ncalculation, and show how it is reconciled with loop calculations in which the\ndifferent formulations can (superficially) appear to give different answers. In\nthis sense any effective theory containing light spin-one particles is seen to\nbe automatically gauge invariant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 1992 16:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 1992 17:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We demonstrate that many\ncalculations, such as those involving anomalous trilinear gauge-boson\ncouplings, either considerably overestimate loop-induced effects, or give\nambiguous answers. The source of these problems is the use of cutoffs to\nevaluate the size of such operators in loop diagrams. In contrast to other\ncritics of these loop estimates, we prove that the inclusion of\nnonlinearly-realized gauge invariance into the low-energy lagrangian is\nirrelevant to this conclusion. We use an explicit example using known\nmulti-Higgs physics above the weak scale to underline these points.

However, it has been shown that the\nsemi-classical equations will give a singularity where the dilaton field\nreaches a certain critical value. Initially, it seems this singularity will be\nhidden inside a black hole. However, as the evaporation proceeds, the dilaton\nfield on the horizon will approach the critical value but the temperature and\nrate of emission will remain finite.

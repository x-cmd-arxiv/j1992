The metric ansatz is kept in its most general form compatible with\nHamiltonian minisuperspace dynamics. Nontrivial theta-sectors admitting a\nsemiclassical no-boundary wave function are shown to exist only in 3+1\ndimensions, and there only for two spatial topologies. In both cases the\nspatial surface is nonorientable and the nontrivial no-boundary theta-sector\nunique. In 2+1 dimensions the nonexistence of nontrivial no-boundary\ntheta-sectors is shown to be of topological origin and thus to transcend both\nthe semiclassical approximation and the minisuperspace ansatz. Relation to the\nnecessary condition given by Hartle and Witt for the existence of no-boundary\ntheta-states is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 1992 21:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

For given toroidal\nbackgrounds, the unbroken gauge symmetries (corresponding to holomorphic and\nantiholomorphic worldsheet currents) generate area-preserving diffeomorphism\nalgebras of null 2-tori. A minimal Lie algebraic closure containing all the\ngauge symmetries that arise in this way, is the background--independent\nvolume--preserving diffeomorphism algebra of the target Narain torus $T^{4,4}$.\nThe underlying symmetries act on the ground ring of functions on $T^{4,4}$ as\nderivations, much as in the case of the $d=2$ string. A background--independent\nspacetime action valid for noncompact metrics is presented, whose symmetries\nare volume--preserving diffeomorphisms.

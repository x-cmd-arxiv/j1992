The\nacceptable solutions closely specify the quark masses and mixings, but lie at\nthe edges of allowed regions at 90% confidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 1992 16:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

We find a small\ndecrease in the amount that the operator needs to be renormalized, relative to\nthe unimproved case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 1992 23:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

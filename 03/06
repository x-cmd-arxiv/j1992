These invariants are constructed from several BRST\ncohomology sequences. They provide a systematic and clear characterization of\nnon-local observables in general relativity with unbroken diffeomorphism\ninvariance, and could yield further differential invariants for four-manifolds.\nThe theory includes fluctuations of the vierbein fields, but there exits a\nnon-trivial phase which can be expressed in terms of Witten's topological\nquantum field theory. In this phase, the descent sequences are degenerate, and\nthe corresponding classical solutions can be identified with the conformally\nself-dual sector of Einstein manifolds. The full theory includes fluctuations\nwhich bring the system out of this sector while preserving diffeomorphism\ninvariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 1992 13:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

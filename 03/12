One can get rid of the second domain by gauging the discrete\nsymmetry on the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset that interchanges the two asymptotic domains\nand preserves the Kruskal time orientation everywhere in the Kruskal plane.\nHere it is shown that upon performing this orbifold procedure, we obtain a\ntheory of unoriented open and closed strings in a black hole background, with\njust one asymptotically flat domain and a time-like orbifold singularity at the\norigin. All of the open string states of the model are confined to the orbifold\nsingularity. We also discuss various physical aspects of the truncated black\nhole, in particular its target duality -- the model is dual to a conventional\nopen string theory in the black hole geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 1992 20:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

That is, nearby\nactions in the space of representations of $SL(n,\\Z)$ into ${\\rm\nDiff}^{+}(\\T^{n})$ are smoothly conjugate to the standard action. In fact, this\nrigidity persists for the standard action of a subgroup of finite index. On the\nother hand, while the $\\Z$ action on $\\T^{n}$ defined by a single hyperbolic\nelement of $SL(n,\\Z)$ is topologically rigid, an infinite dimensional space of\nsmooth conjugacy classes occur in a neighborhood of the linear action.\n  The standard action of $SL(2, \\Z)$ on $\\T^2$ forms an intermediate case, with\ndifferent rigidity properties from either extreme. One can construct continuous\ndeformations of the standard action to obtain an (arbritrarily near) action to\nwhich it is not topologically conjugate.

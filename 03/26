This result is confirmed up to three loop order in pertubation\ntheory by an explicit calculation using (1,0) superfields. In particular, it is\nshown that the finite counterterms which must be introduced into the theory in\norder to maintain (4,0) supersymmetry are precisely the terms that are required\nto establish ultra-violet finiteness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 1992 16:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

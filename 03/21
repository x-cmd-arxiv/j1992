A common feature of these investigations\nthat has not previously been remarked upon is that the Hawking temperature of\nsuch systems appears to be suppressed relative to that of a vacuum blackhole of\nequal horizon area. That is: $k T_H \\leq \\hbar/(4\\pi r_H) \\equiv\n\\hbar/\\sqrt{4\\pi A_H}$. This paper will argue that this suppression is generic.\nSpecifically, it will be shown that\n  \\[ k T_H = {\\hbar\\over4\\pi r_H} \\; e^{-\\phi(r_H)} \\;\n  \\left( 1 - 8\\pi G \\; \\rho_H \\; r_H^2 \\right). \\]\n  Here $\\phi(r_H)$ is an integral quantity, depending on the distribution of\nmatter, that is guaranteed to be positive if the Weak Energy Condition is\nsatisfied. Several examples of this behaviour will be discussed.\nGeneralizations of this behaviour to non--symmetric non--static blackholes are\nconjectured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 1992 18:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 1992 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Previous efforts to resolve this puzzle assume that information\nescapes in corrections to the Hawking process, that an arbitrarily large amount\nof information is transmitted by a planckian energy or contained in a\nPlanck-sized remnant, or that the information is lost to another universe. Each\nof these possibilities has serious difficulties. This paper considers another\nalternative: remnants that carry large amounts of information and whose size\nand mass depend on their information content. The existence of such objects is\nsuggested by attempts to incorporate a Planck scale cutoff into physics. They\nwould greatly alter the late stages of the evaporation process. The main\ndrawback of this scenario is apparent acausal behavior behind the horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 1992 02:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

These are\nbased on the extremization of a non-local and non-additive quantity that we\ncall the variety of a system. In these systems all dynaqmical variables refer\nto relative coordinates or, more generally, describe relations between\nparticles, so that they are invariant under discrete analogues of\ndiffeomorphisms in which the labels of all particles are permutted arbitrarily.\nThe variety is a measures of how uniquely each of the elements of the system\ncan be distinguished from the others in terms of the values of these relative\ncoordinates. Thus a system with extremal variety is one in which the parts are\nrelated to the whole in as distinct a way as possible.\n  We study numerically several dynamical systems which are defined by setting\nthe action of the system equal to its variety. We find evidence that suggests\nthat such systems may serve as the basis for a new kind of pregeometry theories\nin which the geometry of low dimensional space emerges in the thermodynamic\nlimit from a system which is defined without the use of any background space.\n  The mathematical definition of variety may also provide a quantitative tool\nto study self-organizing systems, because it distinguishes highly structured,\nbut asymmetric, configurations such as one finds in biological systems from\nboth random configurations and highly ordered configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 1992 23:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

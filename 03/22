This allows efficient computation of\nscattering amplitudes in the standard Liouville $\\times$ $c=1$ background.\nMoreover, the solution leads to a mapping from a large class of time-dependent\ncollective field theory backgrounds to corresponding nonlinear sigma models.\nFinally, we derive recursion relations between tachyon amplitudes. These may be\nsummarized by an infinite set of nonlinear PDE's for the partition function in\nan arbitrary time-dependent background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 1992 01:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

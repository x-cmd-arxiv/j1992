A small but nonzero\n$\\theta_{QCD}$ explicitly breaks CP and can lift the degeneracy of the two CP\nconjugate vacua through nonperturbative effects so that the domain walls become\nunstable, but survive to cosmologically interesting epochs. We explore the\nviability of spontaneous CP violation in the context of two Higgs models, and\nfind that the invisible axion solution of the strong CP problem cannot be\nimplemented without further extensions of the Higgs sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 1992 18:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 1992 16:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

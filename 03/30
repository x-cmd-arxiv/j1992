The set of allowed operators is found to depend sensitively\non the nature of the extension of the standard model gauge group. These new\ninteractions lead to additional production processes for the exotic particles\nin such models and allow the LSP to decay but with a highly suppressed rate.\nThe implications of these new interations are examined for the Tevatron, SSC,\nLHC, HERA, and sqrt{s} = 0.5 and 1 TeV e+e- colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 1992 11:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The classical equations of the theory are the complex\n$sl(n)$ affine Toda equations which admit soliton solutions with real masses.\nThe classical scattering theory of the solitons is developed using Hirota's\nsolution techniques. A form for the soliton $S$-matrix is proposed based on the\nconstraints of $S$-matrix theory, integrability and the requirement that the\nsemi-classical limit is consistent with the semi-classical WKB quantization of\nthe classical scattering theory. The proposed $S$-matrix is an intertwiner of\nthe quantum group associated to $sl(n)$, where the deformation parameter is a\nfunction of the coupling constant. It is further shown that the $S$-matrix\ndescribes a non-unitary theory, which reflects the fact that the classical\nHamiltonian is complex. The spectrum of the theory is found to consist of the\nbasic solitons, scalar states (or breathers) and excited (or `breathing')\nsolitons. It is also noted that the construction of the $S$-matrix is valid for\nany representation of the Hecke algebra, allowing the definition of restricted\n$S$-matrices, in which case the theory is unitary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 1992 09:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

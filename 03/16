While agreeing with the\ngeneral considerations made by Burgess and Marini, I correct their actual\ncalculation of the damping rates, which is based on a wrong expression for the\nstatic limit of the resummed gluon propagator. The effect of this, however,\nturns out to be cancelled fortuitously by another mistake, so as to leave all\nof their conclusions unchanged.

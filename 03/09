In these models the required pattern of\nbreaking of lepton-number symmetry takes place near the electroweak scale and\nall mass heirarchies are technically natural. The models are compatible with\nall cosmological and astrophysical constraints, and can solve the solar\nneutrino problem via either the MSW effect or vacuum oscillations. The deficit\nin atmospheric muon neutrinos seen in the Kamiokande and IMB detectors can also\nbe explained in these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 1992 23:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

When the resulting\nnonlocal field theory is quantized using the functional formalism --- with unit\nmeasure factor --- its Green's functions are finite to all orders. The\nconstruction also ensures perturbative unitarity to all orders for scalars with\nnonderivative interactions, however, decoupling is lost at one loop when vector\nand tensor quanta are present. Decoupling can be restored (again, to all\norders) if a suitable measure factor exists. We compute the required measure\nfactor for pure Yang-Mills at order $g^2$ and then use it to evaluate the\nvacuum polarization at one loop. A peculiar feature of our regularization\nscheme is that the on-shell tree amplitudes are completely unaffected. This\nimplies that the nonlocal field theory can be viewed as a highly noncanonical\nquantization of the original, local field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 1992 18:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

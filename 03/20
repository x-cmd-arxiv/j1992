The action of maximal commutative\nsubalgebras of the formal loop algebra of GL(n) defined on certain\ninfinite-dimensional Grassmannians is studied. It is proved that every\nfinite-dimensional orbit of the action of traceless elements of these\ncommutative Lie algebras is isomorphic to the Prym variety associated with a\nmorphism of algebraic curves. Conversely, it is shown that every Prym variety\ncan be realized as a finite-dimensional orbit of the action of traceless\ndiagonal elements of the formal loop algebra, which defines the multicomponent\nKP system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 1992 13:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2002 19:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

This establishes a bridge between the arithmetic approach of\nHarder, Narasimhan et al. and the gauge group approach of Atiyah and Bott. One\nof the basic ideas is to consider a notion of divisor of higher rank and a\nsuitable Abel-Jacobi map generalizing the classical notions in rank one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 1992 19:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We discuss the application of\nthis model to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by a top-quark\ncondensate. In this model, custodial symmetry is violated solely by\nperturbatively weak interactions, and the top--bottom mass splitting is due to\nthe enhanced sensitivity to custodial symmetry violation near the critical\npoint. We also consider models in which electroweak symmetry is broken by new\nstrongly- interacting fermions with NJL-like dynamics. We argue that these\nmodels require additional fine-tuning in order to keep corrections to the\nelectroweak $\\rho$-parameter acceptably small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 1992 19:30:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 1992 01:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

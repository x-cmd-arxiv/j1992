These approaches are based on\ngeneralizations of powerful tools previously applied to problems in one spatial\ndimension. We begin with a review of one-dimensional interacting Fermions. We\nthen introduce a simplified model in two spatial dimensions to study the role\nthat spin and perfect nesting play in destabilizing Fermion liquids. The\ncomplicated functional renormalization group equations of the full problem are\nmade tractable in our model by replacing the continuum of points that make up\nthe closed Fermi line with four Fermi points. Despite this drastic\napproximation, the model exhibits physically reasonable behavior both at\nhalf-filling (where instabilities occur) and away from half-filling (where a\nLuttinger liquid arises). Next we implement the Bosonization of higher\ndimensional Fermi surfaces introduced by Luther and advocated most recently by\nHaldane. Bosonization incorporates the phase space and small-angle scattering\n....

We deduce the Boussinesq and modified Boussinesq equations as\nconstraints on the geometry of the corresponding coset manifolds.The main\ncharacteristic features of these realizations are:i. Among the coset parameters\nthere are the space and time coordinates $x$ and $t$ which enter the Boussinesq\nequations, all other coset parameters are regarded as fields depending on these\ncoordinates;ii. The spin 2 and 3 currents of $W_3$ and two spin 1 $U(1)$ Kac-\nMoody currents as well as two spin 0 fields related to the $W_3$currents via\nMiura maps, come out as the only essential parameters-fields of these cosets.\nThe remaining coset fields are covariantly expressed through them;iii.The Miura\nmaps get a new geometric interpretation as $W_3^{\\infty}$ covariant constraints\nwhich relate the above fields while passing from one coset manifold to another;\niv. The Boussinesq equation and two kinds of the modified Boussinesq equations\nappear geometrically as the dynamical constraints accomplishing $W_3^{\\infty}$\ncovariant reductions of original coset manifolds to their two-dimensional\ngeodesic submanifolds;v. The zero-curvature representations for these equations\narise automatically as a consequence of the covariant reduction.

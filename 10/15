Exact conformal field theories that describe gravitational\nbackgrounds such as black holes and more intricate gravitational singularities\nhave been discovered and investigated at the classical and quantum level. These\nmodels are described by gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models, or equivalently\ncurrent algebra G/H coset models based on non-compact groups, with a single\ntime coordinate. The classification of such models for all dimensions is\ncomplete. Furthermore the heterotic superstrings in curved spacetime based on\nnon-compact groups have also been constructed. For many of the $d\\le 4$ models\nthe gravitational geometry described by a sigma model has been determined. Some\ngeneral results outlined here include a global analysis of the geometry and the\nexact classical geodesics for any G/H model. Moreover, in the quantized theory,\nthe conformally exact metric and dilaton are obtained for all orders in an\nexpansion of $k$ (the central extension). All such models have large-small (or\nmirror) duality properties which we reformulate as an inversion in group space.\nTo illustrate model building techniques a specific 4-dimensional heterotic\nstring in curved spacetime is presented. Finally the methods for investigating\nthe quantum theory are outlined. The construction and analysis of these models\nat the classical and quantum level involve some aspects of noncompact groups\nwhich are not yet sufficiently well understood. Some of the open problems in\nthe physics and mathematics areas are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 1992 02:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 1992 22:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

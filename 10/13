Quantum mechanics aims at\npredicting the probabilities of alternative coarse-grained time histories of a\nclosed system. Not every set of alternative coarse-grained histories that can\nbe described may be consistently assigned probabilities because of quantum\nmechanical interference between individual histories of the set. In the quantum\nmechanics of closed systems, containing both observer and observed,\nprobabilities are assigned to those sets of alternative histories for which\nthere is negligible interference between individual histories as a consequence\nof the system's initial condition and dynamics. Such sets of histories are said\nto decohere. Typical mechanisms of decoherence that are widespread in our\nuniverse are illustrated. Copenhagen quantum mechanics is an approximation to\nthe more general quantum framework of closed subsystems. It is appropriate when\nthere is an approximately isolated subsystem that is a participant in a\nmeasurement situation in which (among other things) the decoherence of\nalternative registrations of the apparatus can be idealized as exact. Since the\nquantum mechanics of closed systems does not posit the existence of the\nquasiclassical domain of everyday experience, the domain of the approximate\naplicability of classical physics must be explained. We describe how a\nquasiclassical domain described by averages of densities of approximately\nconserved quantities could be an emergent feature of an initial condition of\nthe universe that implies the approximate classical behavior of spacetime on\naccessible scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 1992 00:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 21:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

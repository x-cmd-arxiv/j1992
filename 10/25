We give a summary of\nthe cosmic string and global texture models, focusing on distinct observational\nsignatures in large-scale structure surveys and in the microwave background. It\nis shown that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole detected by COBE is in good\nagreement with the predictions of the cosmic string model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 1992 20:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

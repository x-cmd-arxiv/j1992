This\nrules out a recently proposed scenario for the RG description of first-order\nphase transitions. On the pathological side, we make rigorous some arguments of\nGriffiths, Pearce and Israel, and prove in several cases that the renormalized\nmeasure is not a Gibbs measure for any reasonable interaction. This means that\nthe RG map is ill-defined, and that the conventional RG description of\nfirst-order phase transitions is not universally valid.

It is shown that the massless spectra of Calabi--Yau manifolds of\ncomplex dimension $D_{crit}$ can be derived from noncritical manifolds of\ncomplex dimension $2k + D_{crit}$, $k\\geq 1$. These higher dimensional\nmanifolds are spaces whose nonzero Ricci curvature is quantized in a particular\nway. This class is more general than that of Calabi--Yau manifolds because it\ncontains spaces which correspond to critical string vacua with no K\\\"ahler\ndeformations, i.e. no antigenerations, thus providing mirrors of rigid\nCalabi--Yau manifolds. The constructions introduced here lead to new insights\ninto the relation between exactly solvable models and their mean field theories\non the one hand and Calabi--Yau manifolds on the other.

Likewise\n$M^{TuTts}_{\\mu}$ depends only on the elastic T-matrix evaluated at four sets\nof (u,t).

The precise expressions for\n$\\bar{M}^{TsTts}_{\\mu}$ and $\\bar{M}^{TuTts}_{\\mu}$ are determined by using the\nradiation decomposition identities of Brodsky and Brown.

At least two different classes\nare required: the amplitudes which depend on s and t or the amplitudes which\ndepend on u and t. When resonance effects are important, the amplitude\n$M^{TsTts}_{\\mu}$, not $M^{Low(st)}_{\\mu}$, should be used.

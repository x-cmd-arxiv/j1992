The\nstudy of jumping lines of these bundles gives a unified treatment of several\nclassical constructions associating a curve to a collection of points in $P^n$.\nThe main result of the paper is \"Torelli theorem\" which says that the\ncollection of hyperplanes can be recovered from the isomorphism class of the\ncorresponding logarithmic bundle unless the hyperplanes ocsulate a rational\nnormal curve. In this latter case our construction reduces to that of secant\nbundles of Schwarzenberger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 1992 22:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The model is based on the\nbiharmonic equation $\\nabla^{4}u =0$ in two-dimensional isotropic defect-free\nmedia as follows from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation for pattern formation\n-or, alternatively, from the theory of elasticity. As a difference with\nLaplacian and Poisson growth models, in the new model the Laplacian of $u$ is\nneither zero nor proportional to $u$. Its discretization allows to reproduce a\ntransition from dense to multibranched growth at a point in which the growth\nvelocity exhibits a minimum similarly to what occurs within Poisson growth in\nplanar geometry. Furthermore, in circular geometry the transition point is\nestimated for the simplest case from the relation $r_{\\ell}\\approx L/e^{1/2}$\nsuch that the trajectories become stable at the growing surfaces in a\ncontinuous limit. Hence, within the biharmonic growth model, this transition\ndepends only on the system size $L$ and occurs approximately at a distance $60\n\\%$ far from a central seed particle. The influence of biharmonic patterns on\nthe growth probability for each lattice site is also analysed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 1992 08:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

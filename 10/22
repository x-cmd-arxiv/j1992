Our results are valid\nin a semiclassical expansion around the average field approximation (AFA). We\nreexamine the AFA and the role of fluctuations. We argue that,\norder-\\-by-\\-order in the semiclassical expansion, the response functions obey\nthe correct symmetry properties required by Galilean and Gauge Invariance and\nby the incompressibility of the fluid. In particular, we find that the\nlow-momentum limit of the semiclassical approximation to the response functions\nis exact and that it saturates the $f$-sum rule.We obtain the spectrum of\ncollective excitations of FQHE systems in the low-momentum limit. We find a\nrich spectrum of modes which includes a host of quasiparticle- quasihole bound\nstates and, in general,two collective modes coalescing at the cyclotron\nfrequency. The Hall conductance is obtained from the current-density\ncorrelation function, and it has the correct value already at the semiclassical\nlevel. We applied these results to the problem of the screening of external\ncharges and fluxes by the electron fluid, and obtained asymptotic expressions\nof the charge and current density profiles, for different types of\ninteractions. Finally, we reconsider the anyon superfluid within our scheme and\nderive the spectrum of collective modes for interacting hard-core bosons and\nsemions. In addition to the gapless phase mode, we find a set of gapped\ncollective modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 1992 16:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

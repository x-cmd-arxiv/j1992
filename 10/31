A major difficulty with this idea is that\nestimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order\nof $\\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux\nentrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of\na galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field\nwe find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to\nmaintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field\nfrom all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than\nprevious seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic\nactivity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to\na dipole seed field of $\\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a\nseed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes\nplace in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic\nclouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a\nlarge scale $B_r\\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller\nscales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 1992 16:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

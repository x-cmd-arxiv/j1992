These manifolds are thus elements\nof {\\em hyperbolic geometry}, as natural as Euclid's regular polyhedra. For a\nclosed manifold, Mostow rigidity assures that a hyperbolic structure is unique\nwhen it exists, so topology and geometry mesh harmoniously in dimension 3.\n  This remarkable theorem applies to all 3-manifolds, which can be built up in\nan inductive way from 3-balls, i.e., {\\em Haken} manifolds. Thurston's\nconstruction of a hyperbolic structure is also inductive. At the inductive step\none must find the right geometry on an open 3-manifold so that its ends may be\nglued together. Using quasiconformal deformations, the gluing problem can be\nformulated as a fixed-point problem for a map of Teichm\\\"uller space to itself.\nThurston proposes to find the fixed point by {\\em iterating} this map.\n  Here we outline Thurston's construction and sketch a new proof that the\niteration converges. Our argument rests on a result entirely in the theory of\nRiemann surfaces: an extremal quasiconformal mapping can be relaxed (isotoped\nto a map of lesser dilatation) when lifted to a sufficiently large covering\nspace (e.g., the universal cover). This contraction gives an immediate estimate\nfor the contraction of Thurston's iteration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

While this scenario\nworks well for strong interactions, it is unsatisfactory for nonleptonic and\nradiative nonleptonic weak interactions: It is impossible, from the outset, to\ndetermine all unknown higher-order chiral couplings by experiment; theory is\ntested only by certain chiral constraints rather than by its quantitative\npredictions. Based on a QCD-motivated model for $p^4$ strong chiral Lagrangian\nvalid in the limit of large $N_c$, one can derive large-$N_c$ fourth-order\neffective chiral Lagrangians for $\\Delta S=1$ nonleptonic weak interactions and\nradiative weak transitions.

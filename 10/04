(i) The size of the unit cell of the $H_{II}$ phase increases\nwith increasing pressure. (ii) The transition volume, $\\Delta V_{bh}$,\ndecreases and appears to vanish as the pressure is increased. (iii) The\nintensity of scattered light increases as $\\Delta V_{bh}$ decreases. Data are\npresented which suggest that this increase is due to the formation of an\nintermediate cubic phase, as predicted by recent theoretical suggestions of the\nunderlying universal phase sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 1992 06:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

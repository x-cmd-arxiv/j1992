I show how heavy fermions do not decouple in the presence of\ndiscrete gauge anomalies. As a consequence, in general, cancellation of\ndiscrete gauge anomalies cannot be described merely in terms of low energy\noperators involving only the light fermions. I also discuss cancellation of\ndiscrete gauge anomalies through a discrete version of the Green-Schwarz (GS)\nmechanism as well as the possibility of discrete gauge R-symmetries and their\nanomalies.\n  Finally, some phenomenological applications are discussed. This includes\nsymmetries guaranteeing absence of FCNC in two-Higgs models and generalized\nmatter parities stabilizing the proton in the supersymmetric standard model. In\nthe presence of a discrete GS mechanism or/and gauge R-symmetries, new\npossibilities for anomaly free such symmetries are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 1992 10:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 1992 09:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We generalize this duality to backgrounds with\nnon--abelian isometries. The procedure we follow consists of gauging the\nisometries of the original action and constraining the field strength $F$ to\nvanish. This new action generates dual theories by integrating over either the\nLagrange multipliers that set F=0 or the gauge fields. We find that this new\nduality transformation maps spaces with non--abelian isometries to spaces that\nmay have no isometries at all. This suggests that duality symmetries in string\ntheories need to be understood in a more general context without regard to the\nexistence of continuous isometries on the target space (this is also indicated\nby the existence of duality in string compactifications on Calabi--Yau\nmanifolds which have no continuous isometries). Physically interesting examples\nto which our formalism apply are the Schwarzschild metric and the 4D charged\ndilatonic black hole. For these spherically symmetric black holes in four\ndimensions, the dual backgrounds are presented and explicitly shown to be new\nsolutions of the leading order string equations. Some of these new backgrounds\nare found to have no continuous isometries (except for time translations) and\nalso have naked singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 1992 14:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 1993 13:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

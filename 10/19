A comparison of\nthe energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\\gamma$-rays from\nquasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates\nthat the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This\nsuggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index\nidentical to that of $\\gamma$-rays for an individual point source. This\nprediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by\nKamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\\nu_\\mu/\\nu_e$ is close to 1, instead\nof 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos. For a further test of the model,\nanalysis of the time variation of $\\gamma$-ray spectra from quasars is\nsuggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 1992 12:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

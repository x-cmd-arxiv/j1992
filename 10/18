Following Brako and Newns, we expand the electronic many-body\nwavefunction in the number of particle-hole pairs (we keep terms up to and\nincluding a single particle-hole pair). We extend their earlier work by\nincluding level crossings, excited neutrals and negative ions. The full set of\nequations of motion are integrated numerically, without further approximations,\nto obtain the many-body amplitudes as a function of time. The velocity and\nwork-function dependence of final state quantities such as the distribution of\nion charges and excited atomic occupancies are compared with experiment. In\nparticular, experiments that scatter alkali ions off clean Cu(001) surfaces in\nthe energy range 5 to 1600 eV constrain the theory quantitatively. The\nneutralization probability of Na$^+$ ions shows a minimum at intermediate\nvelocity in agreement with the theory. This behavior contrasts with that of\nK$^+$, which shows ...

The four vector $m_\\mu \\simeq d_i \\mu_i m_i^2\n~{\\partial_\\mu}\\>(ln T)$ is interpreted as a Chern- Simon type mass of photons,\nwhich is determined by the electric (magnetic) dipole moments $d_i$ ($\\mu_i$)\nof the fermions in the vacuum polarisation loop diagram. The physical\nconsequence of such a photon mass is that, photons of opposite circular\npolarisations, propagating through a hot medium, have different group\nvelocities. We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left\nand right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light\npropagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is $T\n\\sim 100 MeV$) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals\nof frequency $\\omega$ will be $\\Delta t(\\omega) \\simeq 10^{-6} /\\omega$.

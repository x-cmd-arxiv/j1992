It is shown that the linear dilaton vacuum\nspontaneously breaks half the supersymmetries, leaving broken a linear\ncombination of left and right supersymmetries which squares to time\ntranslations. Supersymmetry suggests a spinorial expression for the ADM energy\n$M$, as found by Witten in four-dimensional general relativity. Using this\nexpression it is proven that ${M}$ is non-negative for smooth initial data\nasymptotic (in both directions) to the linear dilaton vacuum, provided that the\n(not necessarily supersymmetric) matter stress tensor obeys the dominant energy\ncondition. A {\\it quantum} positive energy theorem is also proven for the\nsemiclassical large-$N$ equations, despite the indefiniteness of the quantum\nstress tensor. For black hole spacetimes, it is shown that $M$ is bounded from\nbelow by $e^{- 2 \\phi_H}$, where $\\phi_H$ is the value of the dilaton at the\napparent horizon, provided only that the stress tensor is positive outside the\napparent horizon. This is the two-dimensional analogue of an unproven\nconjecture due to Penrose. Finally, supersymmetry is used to prove positive\nenergy theorems for a large class of generalizations of dilaton gravity which\narise in consideration of the quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 1992 23:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

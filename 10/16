This phenomenon occurs, for example, during the\nFreedericksz transition in nematic liquid crystals.The dynamics leads to the\nemergence of finite domains which are locally periodic and independent of each\nother. This picture is substantiated by a finite-size scaling law for the\nstructure factor. The mechanism of evolution towards the final homogeneous\nstate is by local roll destruction and associated reduction of local\nwavenumber. The scaling law breaks down for systems of size comparable to the\nsize of the locally periodic domains. For systems of this size or smaller, an\napparent nonlinear selection of a global wavelength holds, giving rise to long\nlived periodic configurations which do not occur for large systems. We also\nmake explicit the unsuitability of a description of transient pattern dynamics\nin terms of a few Fourier mode amplitudes, even for small systems with a few\nlinearly unstable modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 1992 14:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

By extending the\nMinkowskian framework to a genuine metric-affine spacetime, we find that the\naffine Noether identities and the conformal Killing equations enforce this\nimprovement in a rather natural way. So far, no gravitational dynamics is\ninvolved in our construction.

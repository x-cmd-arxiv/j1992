It is different\nfrom the usual Schr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg formulation that utilizes states on\nspacelike surfaces because it assigns probabilities to different sets of\nalternatives. Sum-over-histories quantum mechanics can be generalized to deal\nwith spacetime alternatives that are not \"at definite moments of time\". An\nexample in field theory is the set of alternative ranges of values of a field\naveraged over a spacetime region. An example in particle mechanics is the set\nof the alternatives defined by whether a particle never crosses a fixed\nspacetime region or crosses it at least once. The general notion of a set of\nspacetime alternatives is a partition (coarse-graining) of the histories into\nan exhaustive set of exclusive classes. With this generalization the\nsum-over-histories formulation can be said to be in fully spacetime form with\ndynamics represented by path integrals over spacetime histories and\nalternatives defined as spacetime partitions of these histories. When\nrestricted to alternatives at definite moments of times this generalization is\nequivalent to Schr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg quantum mechanics. However, the quantum\nmechanics of more general spacetime alternatives does not have an equivalent\nSchr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg formulation. We suggest that, in the quantum theory of\ngravity, the general notion of \"observable\" is supplied by diffeomorphism\ninvariant partitions of spacetime metrics and matter field configurations.

The positions of these poles, on the second\nRiemann sheet of the complex energy plane, are determined by examining the\neigenvalues of the kernel of the Faddeev equations. This suggests that for a\ncertain class of $\\Lambda N$-$\\Sigma N$ potentials we can form a\n$\\Sigma$-hypertriton with a width of about 8 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 1992 09:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism is used to\ncalculate renormalized transport coefficients to one-loop order. Similar\ntheories for isotropic liquids have shown substantial increases of the\nviscosities as the liquid is supercooled or compressed due to feedback from the\ndensity fluctuations which are freezing. We find similar results here for the\nlongitudinal and various shear viscosities of the nematic. However, the two\nviscosities associated with the nematic director motion do not grow in any\ndramatic way; i.e.\\ there is no apparent freezing of the director modes within\nthis hydrodynamic formalism. Instead a glassy state of the nematic may arise\nfrom a ``random anisotropy\" coupling of the director to the frozen density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 1992 18:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

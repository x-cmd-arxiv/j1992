In the annealed\napproximation (n=1), the inverse gaussian distribution is found to be the\nstable one under rescaling. This identification is made based on symmetry\narguments and subtle relations between this model and that of fluc- tuating\ninterfaces studied by Wallace and Zia. The renormalization-group flow for the\nratios between consecutive cumulants shows a regime of pure diffusion for small\ndisorder, in which P(D) goes to delta(D-<D>), and a regime of strong disorder\nwhere the cumulants grow infinitely large and the diffusion process is ill\ndefined. The boundary between these two regimes is associated with an unstable\nfixed-point and a subdiffusive behavior: <x**2>=Ct**(1-d/2). For the quenched\ncase (n goes to 0) we find that unphysical operators are generated raisng\ndoubts on the renormalizability of this model.

We evaluate\nthe energy shift from the quantum fluctuations about the non-uniform background\n({\\it i.e.}, the effective action) and compare it to the energy from the\neffective potential. Our results clearly show that for inhomogeneous\nconfigurations it may be inadequate to omit derivative terms and confine\noneself to the effective potential. We then couple the kink field to an\nadditional scalar field and perform the same comparison. The addition of the\nsecond field allows us to vary the mass of the fluctuations and their coupling\nto the underlying kink. If the mass of the second field is large, it does not\nfeel the inhomogeneities in the kink field and consequently does not give rise\nto important derivative corrections in the effective action. In contrast, if\nthe mass is small, derivative terms are significant and the effective potential\nfails. In the latter regime we can, however, rely on the Born approximation to\ncalculate the effective action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 1992 22:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

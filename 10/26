It discusses the local invariances of a number of\nsuperparticle actions and highlights the problem of finding a covariant\nquantization scenario. Covariant quantization has proved problematic, but it\nhas motivated in seeking alternative approaches that avoids those found in\nearlier models. It also shows new covariant superparticle theories formulated\nin extended spaces that preserve certain canonical form in phase-space, and\neasy to quantize by using the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure, as the gauge\nalgebra of their constraints only closes on-shell. The mechanics actions\ndescribe particles moving in a superspace consisting of the usual $N=1$\nsuperspace, together with an extra spinor or vector coordinate. A light-cone\nanalysis shows that all these new superparticle models reproduce the physical\nspectrum of the N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 1992 19:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show in\nparticular how the anti-de~Sitter optimally localized (coherent) states\ncontract to plane waves as the curvature goes to zero.

The invariant positive K\\\"ahler\npolarization that selects the anti-de~Sitter quantum elementary system is shown\nto have as zero curvature limit the Poincar\\'e polarization which is no longer\nK\\\"ahler.

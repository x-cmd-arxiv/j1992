There are two such\nextended Virasoro algebras, one of which was constructed earlier, involving a\nfractional spin (equivalently, conformal dimension) 6/5 current. The new\nalgebra involves two additional fractional spin currents with spin 13/5. Both\nalgebras are non-local and satisfy non-abelian braiding relations. The\nconstruction of the algebras uses the isomorphism between the Z_8 parafermion\ntheory and the tensor product of two tricritical Ising models. For the special\nvalue of the central charge c=52/55, corresponding to the eighth member of the\nunitary minimal series, the 13/5 currents of the new algebra decouple, while\ntwo spin 23/5 currents (level-2 current algebra descendants of the 13/5\ncurrents) emerge. In addition, it is shown that the K=8 algebra involving the\nspin 13/5 currents at central charge c=12/5 is the appropriate algebra for the\nconstruction of the K=8 (four-dimensional) fractional superstring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1992 20:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Even before coupling to gravity, the\ntopological torus has an infinite number of point-like physical observables,\nwhich give rise via the BRST descent equations to an infinite symmetry algebra\nof the model. The point-like observables of ghost number zero form a\ntopological ground ring, whose generators span a spacetime manifold; the\nsymmetry algebra represents all (ground ring valued) diffeomorphisms of the\nspacetime. At nonzero ghost numbers, the topological ground ring is extended to\na superring, the spacetime manifold becomes a supermanifold, and the symmetry\nalgebra preserves a symplectic form on it. In a decompactified limit of\ncylindrical target topology, we find a nilpotent charge which behaves like a\nspacetime topological BRST operator. After coupling to topological gravity,\nthis model might represent a topological phase of $c=1$ string theory. We also\npoint out some analogies to two dimensional superstrings with the chiral GSO\nprojection, and to string theory with $c=-2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1992 22:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

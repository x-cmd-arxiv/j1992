For space-like vector fields of space-times this index is invariant\nunder all coordinate transformations. We propose the following physical\nprincipal: For physical vector fields the index changes only when there is\nradiation. As an implication of this principal we predict that any physical\npsuedo-vector field has index zero. The definition of the index is quite\nelementary. It only depends upon the concepts of continuity, compactness, the\nEuler-Poincare number, and the idea of inward pointing. The proof that this\ndefinition is well defined takes up most of the paper.

This paper will use\nseveral simple examples to argue that the universe appears to exhibit a\n``defense in depth'' strategy in this regard. For appropriate parameter regimes\nCasimir effects, wormhole disruption effects, and gravitational back reaction\neffects all contribute to the fight against time travel.

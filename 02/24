Quantum\nstates are now holomorphic functionals of self dual connections and a\ndecomposition of fields into positive and negative frequency parts is\nunnecessary. The construction requires the introduction of new mathematical\ntechniques involving ``holomorphic distributions''. The method extends also to\nlinear gravitons in Minkowski space. The fact that one can recover the entire\nFock space --with particles of both helicities-- from self dual connections\nalone provides independent support for a non-perturbative, canonical\nquantization program for full general relativity based on self dual variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 1992 05:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

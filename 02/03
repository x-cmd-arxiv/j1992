In the standard gauged WZW theory, vector gauge fields (\\ie\\\nwith vector gauge couplings) are in the adjoint representation of the subgroup\n$H \\subset G$. In this paper, we show that, in the conformal limit in two\ndimensions, there is a gauged WZW theory where the gauge fields are chiral and\nbelong to the subgroups $H_L$ and $H_R$ where $H_L$ and $H_R$ can be different\ngroups. In the special case where $H_L=H_R$, the theory is equivalent to vector\ngauged WZW theory. For general groups $H_L$ and $H_R$, an examination of the\ncorrelation functions (or more precisely, conformal blocks) shows that the\nchiral gauged WZW theory is equivalent to $(G/H)_L\\otimes (G/H)_R$ coset models\nin conformal field theory. The equivalence of the vector gauged WZW theory and\nthe corresponding $G/H$ coset theory then follows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 1992 23:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-08"}

Near this limit a neighborhood of the horizon of the black\nhole is closely approximated by a trivial product of a two-dimensional black\nhole with a sphere. This is shown to imply that the scattering of\nlong-wavelength particles can be described by a (previously analyzed)\ntwo-dimensional effective field theory, and is related to the\nformation/evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. The scattering proceeds\nvia particle capture followed by Hawking re-emission, and naively appears to\nviolate unitarity. However this conclusion can be altered when the effects of\nbackreaction are included. Particle-hole scattering is discussed in the light\nof a recent analysis of the two-dimensional backreaction problem. It is argued\nthat the quantum mechanical possibility of scattering off of extremal black\nholes implies the potential existence of additional quantum numbers - referred\nto as ``quantum whiskers'' - characterizing the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1992 06:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

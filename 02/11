Then a\nclassical result by Orlik \\& Solomon asserts that the cohomology algebra of the\ncomplement can be constructed from the combinatorial data that are given by the\nintersection lattice.\n  If $B'$ is, more generally, a $2$-arrangement in $R^{2d}$ (an arrangement of\nreal subspaces of codimension $2$ with even-dimensional intersections), then\nthe intersection lattice still determines the cohomology {\\it groups} of the\ncomplement, as was shown by Goresky \\& MacPherson. We prove, however, that for\n$2$-arrangements the cohomology {\\it algebra} is not determined by the\nintersection lattice. It encodes extra information on sign patterns, which can\nbe computed from determinants of linear relations or, equivalently, from\nlinking coefficients in the sense of knot theory. This also allows us (in the\ncase $d=2$) to identify arrangements with the same lattice but different\nfundamental groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 1992 07:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Assuming such a theory to be integrable, we show\nhow to calculate the multi-kink energy levels in finite volume given its\nfactorizable $S$-matrix. In massive theories this can be done exactly up to\ncontributions due to off-shell and tunneling effects that fall off\nexponentially with volume. As a first application we compare our analytical\npredictions for the kink scattering theories conjectured to describe the\nsubleading thermal and magnetic perturbations of the tricritical Ising model\nwith numerical results from the truncated conformal space approach. In\nparticular, for the subleading magnetic perturbation our results allow us to\ndecide between the two different $S$-matrices proposed by Smirnov and\nZamolodchikov.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 1992 04:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

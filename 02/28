Schreier can be iterated to\nproduce for each alpha < omega_1, a weakly null sequence (x^{alpha}_n)_n in\nC(omega^{omega^{alpha}})) with complexity alpha. As in the Schreier example\neach of these is a sequence of indicator functions which is a suppression-1\nunconditional basic sequence. These sequences are used to construct\nTsirelson-like spaces of large index. We also show that this new ordinal index\nis related to the Lavrentiev index of a Baire-1 function and use the index to\nsharpen some results of Alspach and Odell on averaging weakly null sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

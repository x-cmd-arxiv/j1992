The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical basis for this\nproposal.\n  The quantum holonomy algebra is constructed, and, in the case of real\nconnections, given the structure of a certain C-star algebra. A proper\nrepresentation theory is then provided using the Gel'fand spectral theory. A\ncorollory of these general results is a precise formulation of the ``loop\ntransform'' proposed by Rovelli and Smolin. Several explicit representations of\nthe holonomy algebra are constructed. The general theory developed here implies\nthat the domain space of quantum states can always be taken to be the space of\nmaximal ideals of the C-star algebra. The structure of this space is\ninvestigated and it is shown how observables labelled by ``strips'' arise\nnaturally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 1992 19:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The Fock space of graviton states and\nits associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionals\nof loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that is\nchiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for the\nHamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handed\ngravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of the\nlinearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than into\npositive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, is\nmeaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful in\nconnecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalism\ndepends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certain\ndivergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite of\nthese somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here is\ncompletely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 1992 20:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

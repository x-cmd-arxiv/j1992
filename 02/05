The soliton content and exact S-matrices are\nobtained using the Landau-Ginzburg description. We study the thermodynamics of\nthese theories and calculate the ground-state energies exactly, verifying that\nthey have the correct conformal limits.

Using a hydrodynamical formulation we obtain a two-dimensional\ndroplet picture of one-dimensional fermions. The dynamics involved is that of\nthe boundary between a uniform density of particles and vortices. We use the\nsharp boundary approximation. In the case of well separated boundaries we\nderive the one-dimensional collective field Hamiltonian. Symmetries of the\ntheory are also discussed as properties of curves in two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 1992 22:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

A thermal description is\ninadequate for extremal holes. In particular, extreme holes of the charged\ndilaton family can have zero entropy but non-zero, and even (for $a>1$)\nformally infinite, temperature. The existence of a tendency to radiate at the\nextreme, which threatens to overthrow any attempt to identify the entropy as\navailable internal states and also to expose a naked singularity, is at first\nsight quite disturbing. However by analyzing the perturbations around the\nextreme holes we show that these holes are protected by mass gaps, or\nalternatively potential barriers, which remove them from thermal contact with\nthe external world. We suggest that the behavior of these extreme dilaton black\nholes, which from the point of view of traditional black hole theory seems\nquite bizarre, can reasonably be interpreted as the holes doing their best to\nbehave like normal elementary particles. The $a<1$ holes behave qualitatively\nas extended objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 1992 01:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

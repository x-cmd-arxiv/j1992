The global properties of all such solutions are\nderived by studying the phase space of field equations in the equivalent theory\nof gravity coupled to a scalar field, which is obtained by a field redefinition\nand conformal transformation. The following uniqueness theorem is obtained:\nprovided that the coefficient of the $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian polynomial is\npositive then the only static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat\nsolution with a regular horizon in these models is the Schwarzschild solution.\nOther branches of solutions with regular horizons, which are asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter, or de Sitter, are also found. An exact Schwarzschild-de Sitter\ntype solution is found to exist in the $R+aR^2$ if $D>4$. If terms of cubic or\nhigher order in $R$ are included in the action, then such solutions also exist\nin four dimensions. The general Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solution for\narbitrary $D$ and $n$ is given. The fact that the Schwarzschild solution in\nthese models does not coincide with the exterior solution of physical bodies\nsuch as stars has important physical implications which we discuss. As a\nbyproduct, we classify all static spherically symmetric solutions of\n$D$-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential consisting\nof a finite sum of exponential terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 1992 22:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 1992 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

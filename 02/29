Fixed points of the gauged\ntransformations induce metric singularities and, in the case of abelian\nsubgroups $H$, become horizons in a dual geometry. We also give a\nclassification of models with a single timelike coordinate together with an\nexplicit list for dimensions $D\\leq 10$. We study in detail the class of models\ndescribed by the cosets $SL(2,\\IR)\\otimes SO(1,1)^{D-2}/SO(1,1)$. For $D\\geq 2$\neach coset represents two different spacetime geometries: (2D black\nhole)$\\otimes \\IR^{D-2}$ and (3D black string)$\\otimes \\IR^{D-3}$ with\nnonvanishing torsion. They are shown to be dual in such a way that the\nsingularity of the former geometry (which is not due to a fixed point) is\nmapped to a regular surface (i.e.\\ not even a horizon) in the latter . These\ncosets also lead to the conformal field theory description of known and new\ncosmological string models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 1992 14:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

If X has dimension 3 and is not\nuniruled, then X has a minimal model (with terminal singularities) [Mori]. In\nearlier work we have shown that there exists a birationally equivalent elliptic\nfibration p: Y -> T such that Y is minimal and a multiple of K_Y can be\nexpressed as the pullback of a divisor from T. Moreover T has at worst quotient\nsingularities; it is not difficult to find examples where T is actually\nsingular. In this paper we describe the singularities of this parameter surface\nT in the case of no multiple fibers. Although T is not uniquely determined by\nthe birational equivalence class of the fibration, any two such T are related\nby a particular kind of birational map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 1992 22:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

This theory is quantized in the loop\nrepresentation and, as in the full theory, an infinite dimnensional space of\nexact solutions to the constraint is found. An inner product is also proposed.\nThe path integral is constructed from the Hamiltonian theory and the measure is\nexplicitly computed nonperturbatively, without relying on a semiclassical\nexpansion. This theory could provide the starting point for a new approach to\nperturbation theory in $G_{Newton}$ that does not rely on a background field\nexpansion and in which full diffeomorphism invariance is satisfied at each\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 1992 14:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

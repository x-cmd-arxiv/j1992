We prove in this paper new\nrestrictions on arrangement of nonsingular real algebraic curves on an\nellipsoid. These restrictions are analogues of Gudkov-Rokhlin,\nGudkov-Krakhnov-Kharlamov, Kharlamov-Marin congruences for plane curves (see\ne.g. \\cite{V} or \\cite{V1}). To prove our results we follow Marin approach\n\\cite{Marin} that is a study of the quotient space of a surface under the\ncomplex conjugation. Note that the Rokhlin approach \\cite{R} that is a study of\nthe 2-sheeted covering of the surface branched along the curve can not be\ndirectly applied for a proof of Theorem \\ref{Rokhlin} since the homology class\nof a curve of Theorem \\ref{Rokhlin} can not be divided by 2 hence such a\ncovering space does not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 1992 03:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Various\nfeatures of the theory can be more easily understood in the canonical approach,\nlike gauge indipendence of the path-integral results and the absence of the\nlocal physical degrees of freedom. By performing a non-canonical transformation\nof the phase space variables, we show that the theory takes a free-field form,\ni.e. the constraints become the free-field Virasoro constraints. This implies\nthat the David-Distler-Kawai results can be derived in the gauge indipendent\nway, and also proves the free-field assumption which was used for obtaining the\nspectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. A discussion of the physical\nspectrum of the theory is presented, with an analysis of the unitarity of the\ndiscrete momentum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 1992 17:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 1992 17:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

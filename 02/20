For a good brief survey of the\nhistory and role of toric varieties see [10]. Any toric variety $X$ contains a\ncover by affine open sets described in terms of arrangements (called fans) of\nconvex bodies in $\\Bbb R^r$. The coordinate rings of each of these affine open\nsets is a graded ring generated over the ground field by monomials. As a\nconsequence, toric varieties provide a good context in which cohomology can be\ncalculated. The purpose of this article is to describe the second \\'etale\ncohomology group with coefficients in the sheaf of units of any toric variety\n$X$. This is the so-called cohomological Brauer group of $X$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1992 16:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Since then, Nair and Mazur, have\nassociated the $\\Theta $ vacua structure in QCD with self-intersecting Riemann\nsurfaces immersed in four dimensions. From here they concluded that these 2D\nsurfaces correspond to the non-perturbative phase of QCD and carry the\ntopological information of the $\\Theta$ vacua. In this paper we would like to\nelaborate on this point by making use of Atiyah's identification. We will argue\nthat an effective description of QCD may be more like a $WZW$ model coupled to\nthe induced metric of an immersion of a 2-D Riemann surface in $R^4$. We make\nsome further comments on the relationship between the coadjoint orbits of the\nKac-Moody group on $G$ and instantons with axial symmetry and monopole charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1992 21:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Based on the target space modular invariance\nof the nonperturbative superpotential of the four-dimensional $N=1$\nsupersymmetric string vacua, topologically stable stringy domain walls are\nfound. Explicit supersymmetric solutions for the modulus field and the metric,\nwhich saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, are presented. They interpolate between\n{\\it non-degenerate} vacua. As a corollary, this defines a new notion of vacuum\ndegeneracy of supersymmetric vacua. Nonsupersymmetric stringy domain walls are\ndiscussed as well. The moduli sectors with more than one modulus and the\nnon-compact continous symmetry preserved allow for global monopole-type and\ntexture-type configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1992 21:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

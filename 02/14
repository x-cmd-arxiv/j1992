A prominent role is played by the modular weights of the massless\nfields. We present a general classification of all possible modular weights of\nmassless fields in Abelian orbifolds. We show that the cancellation of modular\nanomalies strongly constrains the massless fermion content of the theory, in\nclose analogy with the standard ABJ anomalies. We emphasize the validity of\nthis approach not only for (2,2) orbifolds but for (0,2) models with and\nwithout Wilson lines. As an application one can show that one cannot build a\n${\\bf Z}_3$ or ${\\bf Z}_7$ orbifold whose massless charged sector with respect\nto the (level one) gauge group $SU(3)\\times SU(2) \\times U(1)$ is that of the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model, since any such model would necessarily\nhave duality anomalies. A general study of those constraints for Abelian\norbifolds is presented. Duality anomalies are also related to the computation\nof string threshold corrections to gauge coupling constants.

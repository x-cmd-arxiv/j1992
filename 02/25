This includes a determination of the nature\nof the phase transition, a discussion of the possible role of higher order\nradiative corrections and the theory of the formation and evolution of the\nbubbles of the new phase. We find in particular that no dangerous linear terms\nappear in the effective potential. However, the strength of the first order\nphase transition is 2/3 times less than what follows from the one-loop\napproximation. This rules out baryogenesis in the minimal version of the\nelectroweak theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 1992 20:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

One is led to an\nextension of the braid group and the Hecke algebras which reduce to the known\nones when the two parameter coincide. The physical significance of the two\nparameters is discussed. When both are equal to one, one gets a\nPokrovski-Talapov phase transition. We also show that the representation theory\nof the quantum superalgebras indicates how to take the appropriate\nthermodynamical limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 1992 16:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Apart from their obvious condensed\nmatter interest, the corresponding critical theories represent non-trivial\nsolutions of open string field theory, and a detailed account of their\nproperties would be interesting from several points of view. A subject of\nparticular interest is the dependence of physical quantities on the magnetic\nfield since it, much like $\\theta_{\\rm QCD}$, serves only to give relative\nphases to different sectors of the partition sum. In this paper we report the\nresults of an initial investigation of the free energy, $N$-point functions and\nboundary state of this type of critical theory. Although our primary goal is\nthe study of the magnetic field dependence of these quantities, we will present\nsome new results which bear on the zero magnetic field case as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 1992 21:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

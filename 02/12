J","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"alg-geom math.AG","license":null,"abstract":"  On an arbitrary toric variety, we introduce the logarithmic double complex,\nwhich is essentially the same as the algebraic de Rham complex in the\nnonsingular case, but which behaves much better in the singular case. Over the\nfield of complex numbers, we prove the toric analog of the algebraic de Rham\ntheorem which Grothendieck formulated and proved for general nonsingular\nalgebraic varieties re-interpreting an earlier work of Hodge-Atiyah. Namely,\nfor a finite simplicial fan which need not be complete, the complex cohomology\ngroups of the corresponding toric variety as an analytic space coincide with\nthe hypercohomology groups of the single complex associated to the logarithmic\ndouble complex. They can then be described combinatorially as Ishida's\ncohomology groups for the fan. We also prove vanishing theorems for Ishida's\ncohomology groups. As a consequence, we deduce directly that the complex\ncohomology groups vanish in odd degrees for toric varieties which correspond to\nfinite simplicial fans with full-dimensional convex support. In the particular\ncase of complete simplicial fans, we thus have a direct proof for an earlier\nresult of Danilov and the author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 1992 00:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We consider two cases: a)\nmatter is realized by one free field with an imaginary background charge, b)\nmatter is realized by $D$ free fields: $c_M =D$. In case a) the cohomology\nstates can be labelled by integers $r,s$ of a rotated $c_M =1$ theory, but\nhermiticity imposes $r=s$. Thus there is still a discrete set of momenta\n$p_M(r,r),\\ p_L(r,r)$ such that there are non- trivial (relative) cohomology\nstates at level $r^2$ with ghost-numbers 0 or 1 (for $r>0$) and ghost-numbers 0\nor $-1$ (for $r<0$). The (chiral) ground ring is isomorphic to a subring of the\n$c_M =1$ theory which is $(xy)^n,\\ n=0,1,2,\\ldots$, and there are {\\it no}\nnon-trivial currents acting on the ground ring. In case b) there is no\nnon-trivial relative cohomology for non-zero ghost numbers and, for zero ghost\nnumber, the cohomology groups are isomorphic to a $(D-1)$-dimensional on-shell\n``transverse\" Fock space. The only exceptions are at level 1 for vanishing\nmatter momentum and $p_L=Q_L(1+r)$ with $r=\\pm 1$, where one has one more\nghost-number zero and a ghost-number $r$ cohomology state. All these results\nfollow quite easily from the existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 1992 17:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

By constructing deformations of admissible metrics we establish\nnecessary conditions on minimal area metrics and a partial converse to\nBeurling's criterion for extremal metrics. We explicitly construct new minimal\narea metrics that do not arise from quadratic differentials.\n  Under the physically motivated assumption of existence of the minimal area\nmetrics, we show there exist neighborhoods of the punctures isometric to a flat\nsemiinfinite cylinder of circumference $2\\pi$, allowing the definition of\ncanonical complex coordinates around the punctures. The plumbing of surfaces\nwith minimal area metrics is shown to induce a metric of minimal area on the\nresulting surface. This implies that minimal area string diagrams define a\nconsistent quantum closed string field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1992 02:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

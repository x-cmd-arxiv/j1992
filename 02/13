Math. 98, 1989)\nthat a reduced algebraic plane curve is regular at infinity if and only if its\nlink at infinity is a regular toral link. This conjecture has also been proved\nby Ha H.~V. using Lojasiewicz numbers at infinity. Our first proof uses the\npolar invariant and the second proof uses linear systems of plane curve\nsingularities. The second approach (based on a paper in preparation) also\nproves a stronger conjecture (loc. cit.) describing topologically the regular\nlink at infinity associated with an irregular link at infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 1992 16:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The main result is\nthat a non-zero higher direct image under a proper map of the ideal sheaf of a\ncompatibly Frobenius split subvariety can not have a support whose inverse\nimage is contained in that subvariety. Earlier vanishing theorems for Frobenius\nsplit varieties were based on direct limits and Serre's vanishing theorem, but\nour theorem is based on inverse limits and Grothendieck's theorem on formal\nfunctions. The result implies a Grauert--Riemenschneider type theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 1992 08:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

At the same time, it has become\napparent that there exist very close connections between the various\ncharacterizations of Jacobian varieties described in Mumford's classic lectures\n{\\it Curves and Their Jacobians\\/}. Until now, the approach via double\ntranslation manifolds has seemed to be quite different from other approaches to\nthe Schottky problem. The purpose of this paper is to bring this last approach\n``into the fold'' as it were, and to show precisely how it relates to\ncharacterizations of Jacobians based on trisecants and flexes of the Kummer\nvariety, and the K.P. equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 1992 13:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

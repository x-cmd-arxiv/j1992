In this\nsituation we determine the graded Lie algebra of all graded derivations over\nthe horizontal projection of a connection and we determine their commutation\nrelations. Finally, for a principal connection on a principal bundle and the\ninduced connection on an associated bundle we show how one may pass from one to\nthe other. The final results relate derivations on vector bundle valued forms\nand derivations over the horizontal projection of the algebra of forms on the\nprincipal bundle with values in the standard vector space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

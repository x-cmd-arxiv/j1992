(Our strategy is a variant of the method\nused by Candelas, de la Ossa, Green, and Parkes in the case of quintic\nhypersurfaces.) We then explain a technique of Griffiths which can be used to\ncompute the Picard-Fuchs equations of hypersurfaces. Finally, we carry out the\ncomputation for four specific examples (including quintic hypersurfaces,\npreviously done by Candelas et al.). This yields predictions for the number of\nrational curves of various degrees on certain hypersurfaces in weighted\nprojective spaces. Some of these predictions have been confirmed by classical\ntechniques in algebraic geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 1992 02:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

These include:\n1) The construction of a class of states which approximate smooth metrics for\nlength measurements on scales, $L$, to order $l_{Planck}/L$. 2) The discovery\nthat any such state must have discrete structure at the Planck length. 3) The\nconstruction of operators for the area of arbitrary surfaces and volumes of\narbitrary regions and the discovery that these operators are finite. 4) The\ndiagonalization of these operators and the demonstration that the spectra are\ndiscrete, so that in quantum gravity areas and volumes are quantized in Planck\nunits. 5) The construction of finite diffeomorphism invariant operators that\nmeasure geometrical quantities such as the volume of the universe and the areas\nof minimal surfaces. These results are made possible by the use of new\ntechniques for the regularization of operator products that respect\ndiffeomorphism invariance. Several new results in the classical theory are also\nreviewed including the solution of the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism\nconstraints in closed form of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson and a new form of\nthe action that induces Chern-Simon theory on the boundaries of spacetime. A\nnew classical discretization of the Einstein equations is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 1992 01:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the case of a perfect fluid galaxy, and of odd-parity waves, there\nis no direct matter-wave interaction and the propagation of the waves is\naffected by the galaxy only through the curvature of the spacetime background\nthrough which the waves propagate. We find that, in addition to the expected\nredshift of the radiation emerging from the galaxy, there is a small amount of\nbackscatter, of order $M/\\omega^2R^3$. We show that there is no suppression of\nradiative power by the factor $1+\\omega^2M^2/4$ as has been recently predicted\nby Kundu. The origin of Kundu's suppression lies in the interpretation of a\nterm in the expansion of the exterior field of the galaxy in inverse powers of\nradius. It is shown why that term is not related to the source strength or to\nthe strength of the emerging radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 1992 02:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

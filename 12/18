The dressing prescription originates in a\ntopological (twisted N=2) theory. The Virasoro constraints are thus related to\nessentially the N=2 null state decoupling equations.

By a\n`dual' construction involving the reparametrization $c=-26$ ghosts, the DDK\ndressing prescription is reproduced from the N=2 symmetry.

We therefore calculate the appearance\nof a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from\ngeneral relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and\nluminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism\nbut instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the\nmass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the\ninclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4\n10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting\n10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge\non. A low mass black hole of M<10^3 M_sun seems to be very unlikely. We provide\na ``Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for black holes'' together with simple scaling\nlaws to provide an easy-to-handle test for the black hole model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 1992 14:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

For $\\omega < k_{n}$,\nthe excitations of the system are the locked states with the phase velocity\n$\\omega/k_{n}$ in all the region of $\\Gamma$ studied. In the first regime, the\nfrequency of the breathers is controlled by $\\omega$, and the velocity of the\nbreathers, controlled by $k_{n}$, is shown to be the group velocity determined\nfrom the linear dispersion relation for the sine-Gordon equation. A linear\nstability analysis reveals that, in addition to two competing length-scales,\nnamely, the width of the breathers and the spatial period of the driving, there\nis one more length-scale which plays an important role in controlling the\ndynamics of the system at small driving. In the second regime the length-scale\n$k_{n}$ controls the excitation. The above picture is further corroborated by\nnumerical nonlinear spectral analysis. An energy balance estimate is also\npresented and shown to predict the critical value of $\\Gamma$ in good agreement\nwith the numerics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 1992 09:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The imposition\nof $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariance seems to be the simplest and most\nnatural way to fulfill this requirement. With this assumption, all the possible\ndeviations from the standard triple gauge boson vertices can be consistently\nparametrized in terms of a finite set of gauge invariant operators. We deal\nhere with those operators that do not give any tree level effect on present\nexperimental observables and constrain them by computing their effects at the\none-loop level.

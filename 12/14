We\nconsider valence bonds singlets, constructed by Schwinger bosons or fermions,\nwhich are variational ground states for quantum antiferromagnets. This\nexpansion is simpler than the familiar expansions of the quantum Heisenberg\nmodel, and thus more instructive. The diagrammatic rules of this expansion\nallow us to prove certain identities to all orders in 1/N. We derive the\non-site spin fluctuations sum rule for arbitrary N. We calculate the\ncorrelations of the one dimensional Valence Bonds Solid states and the\nGutzwiller Projected Fermi Gas upto order 1/N. For the bosons case, we are\nsurprised to find that the mean field, the order 1/N and the exact correlations\nare simply proportional. For the fermions case, the 1/N correction enhances the\nzone edge singularity. The comparison of our leading order terms to known\nresults for N=2, enhances our understanding of large-N approximations in\ngeneral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 1992 04:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

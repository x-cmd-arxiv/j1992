The methodology considered here is self-consistent and variational.\nThere is a dynamical generation of a magnetic gluon mass. This eliminates the\ninfrared problems associated with perturbative QCD calculations at finite\ntemperatures. We obtain here the thermodynamical quantities like free energy\ndensity, pressure and entropy density. We also calculate the temperature\ndependence of SVZ parameter ${\\alpha_{s} \\over \\pi}<{G^a}_{\\mu \\nu } {G^{a \\mu\n\\nu }}>$. The condensate vanishes at the critical temperature in accordance\nwith recent hot sum rule calculations. The present method gives an insight to\nthe vacuum structure in QCD at zero temperature as well as at finite\ntemperatures in a co-ordinated manner. (to appear in Z.

In this paper, the validity of the\nsemiclassical approximation is examined. The total cross section for\nelectromagnetic excitation of a nuclear target by a spinless projectile is\ncalculated in first Born approximation, neglecting recoil. The final result is\nexpressed in terms of correlation functions and convoluted densities in\nconfiguration space. The result agrees with the WWF approximation to leading\norder(unretarded electric dipole approximation), but the method allows an\nanalytic evaluation of the cutoff, which is determined by the details of the\nelectric dipole transition charge density. Using the Goldhaber-Teller model of\nthat density, and uniform charge densities for both projectile and target, the\ncutoff is determined for the total cross section in the nonrelativistic limit,\nand found to be smaller than values currently used for ED calculations. In\naddition, cross sections are calculated using a phenomenological momentum space\ncutoff designed to model final state interactions. For moderate projectile\nenergies, the calculated ED cross section is found to be smaller than the\nsemiclassical result, in qualitative agreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 1992 20:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

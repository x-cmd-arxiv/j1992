It turns out that\nthese finite-size corrections depend rather strongly on the shape of the\nlattice. This prediction, which has no adjustable parameters, is tested and\naccurately verified for various lattice shapes by means of numerical\nsimulations with a cluster algorithm. This supports also a long-standing\nconjecture on the finite-size effects in Wilson loops of Lattice Gauge\nTheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 1992 18:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

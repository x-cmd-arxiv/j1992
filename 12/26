Through coherent states of gluons simulating\na mean field type of approximation, we show that the off-shell gluon\ncondensates of vacuum generate a mass-like contribution for the quarks, giving\nrise to chiral symmetry breaking. We next note that spontaneous breaking of\nglobal chiral symmetry links the four component quark field operator to the\npion wave function. This in turn yields many hadronic properties in the light\nquark sector in agreement with experiments, leading to the conclusion that low\nenergy hadron properties are primarily driven by the vacuum structure of\nquantum chromodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 1992 20:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

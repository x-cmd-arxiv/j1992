In this note, we evaluate the\nmost singular contributions to the potential at two loops as well as the\nleading strong interaction contributions. Above the critical temperature, the\nstrong interaction corrections are reasonably small, while the weak corrections\nare about 10\\%, even for rather small values of the Higgs field.

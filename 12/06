The fit to the observed magnetic moments including\n$m_q^{1/2}$ corrections is found to be much worse than the tree level SU(3) fit\nif values for the baryon-pion axial coupling constants obtained from a tree\nlevel extraction are used. Using the axial coupling constant values extracted\nat one loop results in a better fit to the magnetic moments than the tree level\nSU(3) fit. There are three linear relations amongst the magnetic moments when\n$m_q^{1/2}$ corrections are included, and one relation including $m_q^{1/2}$,\n$m_q\\ln m_q$ and $m_q$ corrections.

A relative\nversion is also given: If there is an algebraic subvariety $A$ (not necessarily\nreduced) in $S$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $A\\cap\\Omega$ is algebraic,\nthen $f_\\nu$ can be taken to coincide with $f$ on $A\\cap\\Omega_\\nu$. The main\napplication of these results, when $\\Omega$ is the unit disk, is to show that\nthe Kobayashi pseudodistance and the Kobayashi-Royden infinitesimal metric of a\nquasi-projective algebraic manifold $Z$ are computable solely in terms of the\nclosed algebraic curves in $Z$. Similarly, the $p$-dimensional Eisenman metric\nof a quasi-projective algebraic manifold can be computed in terms of the\nEisenman volumes of its $p$-dimensional algebraic subvarieties. Another\nquestion addressed in the paper is whether the approximations $f_\\nu$ can be\ntaken to have their images contained in affine Zariski open subsets of $X$. By\nusing complex analytic methods (pluricomplex potential theory and H\\\"ormander's\n$L^2$ estimates), we show that this is the case if $f$ is an embedding (with\n$\\dim S<\\dim X$) and if there is an ample line bundle $L$ on $X$ such that\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 1992 12:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 1993 13:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 1993 04:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The analysis of different parametrizations in the functional\nrepresentation shows that (i) calculations which take into account constraints\nfor the number of on-site-available states are describing quasiparticles in\nterms of wrong local statistics, and contain gauge non-invariant objects; (ii)\napplication of the projection technique in the slave-boson(fermion)\nrepresentation reproduces the correct statistics, and is exactly equivalent to\nthe conventional diagram technique for Hubbard operators; (iii) it is necessary\nto introduce an additional equation for the effective hopping amplitude for the\nflux phase. With the technique for Hubbard operators, which allows one to\nseparate charge and spin channels we construct the mean-field equations for a\nflux-like state which coexists with N\\'eel antiferromagnetism (AF). The formal\nanalysis shows that the equations for real and imaginary parts of the effective\nhopping amplitude are inconsistent for any $\\theta \\neq 0$ (including $\\theta\n=\\pi /4$ which gives flux 1/2). The hopping amplitude is slightly supressed by\nexchange renormalization. The N\\'eel magnetization $m$ decreases with\nincreasing concentration of holes. The region where antiferromagnetism exists\nis decreasing\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 1992 18:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this\narticle we present the (1+1)-dimensional method for studying general relativity\nof 4-dimensions. We first discuss the general formalism, and subsequently draw\nattention to the algebraically special class of space-times, following the\nPetrov classification. It is shown that this class of space-times can be\ndescribed by the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills action interacting with matter\nfields, with the spacial diffeomorphisms of the 2-surface as the gauge\nsymmetry. The constraint appears polynomial in part, whereas the non-polynomial\npart is a non-linear sigma model type in (1+1)-dimensions. It is also shown\nthat the representations of $w_{\\infty}$-gravity appear naturally as special\ncases of this description, and we discuss briefly the $w_{\\infty}$-geometry in\nterm of the fibre bundle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 1992 18:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In general,\nwhenever large enough repulsive effects in the gravitational background are\npresent, string instabilities develop. In De Sitter space, all the spatial\ncomponents exhibit instability.

Sunyaev {\\it et al.\\/}, Central Bureau of Astronomical\nTelegrams, International Astronomical Union, Circular No.~5481) recently\nreported the observation of a $(545 \\pm 11)$ keV line in the spectrum of the\nCrab Nebula. It is tempting to associate this with the positron-electron\nannihilation line at 511 keV. If this line originates from some transition at\nthe surface of the neutron star in the Crab, we expect a red shift of around\n10\\% rather then the observed blue shift of $\\sim 35$ keV; in fact, this\ngravitational red shift implies that the natural frequency of the observed line\nis also 10\\% higher, or around 600 keV. In this article we shall present a\nmechanism for generating such a split from 511 keV. For this mechanism to be\nsuccessful we require: (a) surface magnetic fields, in the annihilation region,\nto be $(3-8)\\times 10^{12}$~G and to point in our direction, (b) surface\ndensities of $(10^5-10^6)$ g/cc.

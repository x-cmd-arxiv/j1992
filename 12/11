Further, in the loitering scenario, nonlinear growth of\nperturbation occurs more recently ($z\\sim 3-5$) than in the matter dominated\ncase. Differences in the high redshift appearances of the two models will\nresult but observable consequences depend critically on the chosen form, onset\nand duration of the loitering phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 1992 22:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

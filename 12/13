This can be done\neither by choosing a smaller stability subalgebra in the nonlinear realization\nof $w_{1+\\infty}$ symmetry, or by considering a nonlinear realization of some\nextended symmetry, or by combining both options. We show that all these\npossibilities give rise to the multi-field realizations of $w_{1+\\infty}$. We\ndeduce the two-field realization of $w_{1+\\infty}$ proceeding from a coset\nspace of the symmetry group $\\tilde{G}$ which is an extension of $w_{1+\\infty}$\nby the second self-commuting set of higher spin currents. Next, starting with\nthe unextended $w_{1+\\infty}$ but placing all its spin 2 generators into the\ncoset, we obtain a new two-field realization of $w_{1+\\infty}$ which\nessentially involves a $2D$ dilaton. In order to construct the invariant action\nfor this system we add one more field and so get a new three-field realization\nof $w_{1+\\infty}$. We re-derive it within the coset space approach, by applying\nthe latter to an extended symmetry group $\\hat{G}$ which is a nonlinear\ndeformation of $\\tilde{G}$. Finally we present some multi-field generalizations\nof our three-field realization and discuss several intriguing parallels with\n$N=2$ strings and conformal affine Toda theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 1992 20:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

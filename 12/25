It is shown, that the asymptotic behaviour of the CF depends\non the shape and the local geometry of the Fermi surface. In particular, the\nexponent of power law which describes the damping of Friedel oscillations at\nlarge r (-4 for an isotropic Fermi gas) is determined by local geometry of the\nFS. The applications of the obtained results to calculations of the CF in a\nmetal near the electron topological transition and of the RKKY exchange\nintegral are considered as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 1992 08:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

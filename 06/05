Motivated by nucleosynthesis\nconstraints on a possible sterile neutrino (suggested by the solar neutrino\ndeficit and a possible $17\\ keV$ neutrino), we calculate the standard model\ncontributions to the neutrino index of refraction in the early universe,\nfocusing on the period when the temperature was of the order of a few $MeV$.

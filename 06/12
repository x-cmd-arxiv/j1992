These models have a\nfive-dimensional parameter space in contrast with the 21-dimensional one of the\nMSSM. We examine the Higgs one-loop effective potential $V_1=V_0+\\Delta V$, in\nparticular how its renormalization-scale ($Q$) independence is affected by the\napproximations used to calculate $\\Delta V$ and by the presence of a\nHiggs-field-independent term which makes $V_1(0)\\not=0$. We show that the\nlatter must be subtracted out to achieve $Q$-independence. We also discuss our\nown approach to the exploration of the five-dimensional parameter space and the\nfine-tuning constraints within this approach. We apply our methods to the\ndetermination of the allowed region in parameter space of two models which we\nargue to be the prototypes for conventional (SSM) and string (SISM) unified\nmodels. To this end we impose the electroweak breaking constraint by minimizing\nthe one-loop effective potential and study the shifts in $\\mu$ and $B$ relative\nto the values obtained using the tree-level potential. These shifts are most\nsignificant for small values of $\\mu$ and $B$, and induce corresponding shifts\non the lightest $\\mu$- and/or $B$-dependent particle masses, \\ie, those of the\nlightest stau, neutralino, chargino, and Higgs boson states. Finally, we\ndiscuss the predictions for the squark, slepton, and one-loop corrected Higgs\nboson masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 1992 18:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

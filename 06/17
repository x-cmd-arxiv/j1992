Our\nmain tools are the operator product expansion for the high-momentum behavior of\nthe electroweak gauge boson vacuum polarizations and the analyticity of these\npolarizations which relate their low and high momentum behaviors. We show that\nwhereas in large QCD-like technicolor models $S$ is large and positive, in\nwalking technicolor models a negative contribution is emphasized, related to\nthe large anomalous dimension of the technifermion condensate. Thus in walking\ntechnicolor $S$ is determined by a large cancellation of two competing effects.\nThis may result in much smaller values of $S$ than in QCD-like technicolor,\nalthough considerable uncertainties are involved. We conclude that it is\nimpossible to rule out walking technicolor based on the present experimental\nlimits on $S$ and the present theoretical technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 1992 01:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

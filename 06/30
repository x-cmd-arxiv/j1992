It is shown\nthat the gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge tranformations\nrestricted on the space boundary in non-abelian gauge theories with a $\\theta$\nterm has a magnetic monopole structure if there is a magnetic monopole in the\nordinary space. The Dirac's quantization condition in the corresponding quantum\ntheories ensures that the vacuum angle $\\theta$ in the gauge theories must be\nquantized. The quantization rule is derived as $\\theta=2\\pi/n~(n\\neq 0)$ with n\nbeing the topological charge of the magnetic monopole. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the strong CP problem is automatically solved non-perturbatively with the\nexistence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\\pm 1$ with $\\theta=\\pm 2\\pi$. This\nis also true when the total magnetic charge of monopoles are very large\n($|n|\\geq 10^92\\pi$) if it is consistent with the abundance of magnetic\nmonopoles.

In a two-dimensional model in which both gauge symmetries\nand {\\it exact} global symmetries are spontaneously broken, stable vortices may\nfail to exist even though magnetic flux is topologically conserved. Following\nVachaspati and Ach\\'ucarro, I formulate the condition that must be satisfied by\nthe pattern of symmetry breakdown for finite-energy configurations to exist in\nwhich the conserved magnetic flux is spread out instead of confined to a\nlocalized vortex. If this condition is met, vortices are always unstable at\nsufficiently weak gauge coupling. I also describe the properties of defects in\nmodels with an ``accidental'' symmetry that is partially broken by gauge boson\nexchange. In some cases, the spontaneously broken accidental symmetry is not\nrestored inside the core of the defect. Then the structure of the defect can be\nanalyzed using an effective field theory; the details of the physics\nresponsible for the spontaneous symmetry breakdown need not be considered.\nExamples include ``semilocal'' domain walls and vortices that are classically\nunstable, but are stabilized by loop corrections, and ``semilocal'' magnetic\nmonopoles that have an unusual core structure. Finally, I examine the general\ntheory of the ``electroweak strings'' that were recently discussed by\nVachaspati. These arise only in models with gauge boson ``mixing,'' and can\nalways end on magnetic monopoles. Cosmological implications are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 1992 13:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

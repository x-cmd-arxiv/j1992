Detailed results are also specialised to an $O(n)$\nsymmetric model with a single coupling constant. Extra boundary terms are\nintroduced into the action which give rise to either Dirichlet or generalised\nNeumann boundary conditions for the quantum fields. For plane boundaries the\nresulting renormalisation group functions are in accord with earlier results\nbut here the additional terms depending on the extrinsic curvature of the\nboundary are found. Various consistency relations are also checked and the\nimplications of conformal invariance at the critical point where the $\\beta$\nfunction vanishes are also derived. The local Scr\\\"odinger equation for the\nwave functional defined by the functional integral under deformations of the\nboundary is also verified to two loops. Its consistency with the\nrenormalisation group to all orders in perturbation theory is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1992 14:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

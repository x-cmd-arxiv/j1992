Each successive term is suppressed by\npowers of a scale, $\\Lambda_\\chi$, which must be less than of order $4\\pi\nf/\\sqrt{N}$ where $f$ is the Goldstone boson decay constant and $N$ is the\nnumber of flavors. The chiral expansion therefore breaks down at or below $4\n\\pi f/\\sqrt{N}$. We argue that the breakdown of the chiral expansion is\nassociated with the appearance of physical states other than Goldstone bosons.\nBecause of crossing symmetry, some ``isospin'' channels will deviate from their\nlow energy behavior well before they approach the scale at which their low\nenergy amplitudes would violate unitarity. We argue that the estimates of\n``oblique'' corrections from technicolor obtained by scaling from QCD are\nuntrustworthy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 1992 19:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1992 15:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

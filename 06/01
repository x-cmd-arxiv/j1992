In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge\nconjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a\ndiscrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,\n$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but\ncan play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy\nmodel with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such\nwalls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in\nspace. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early\nenough.\n  We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis\nin a realistic $\\soten$ unification model, where\n  Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 1992 12:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

We study the implications\nof low energy data for the leptoquarks couplings and find that the most\nrelevant bound for the HERA cross sections comes from inclusive $c -->\ne^+e^-~+~any$. This bound implies that the $e u --> e c$ cross sections for\nvirtual leptoquarks are just too small for observation of the signal.

However, the prospects for discovering the virtual particles if\ntheir couplings are somewhat below present bounds are very dim. We point out\nthat this cross section could be very large for leptoquarks lighter than HERA's\nkinematical limit, and if such a leptoquark is discovered we recommend\nsearching for a possible $e u --> e c$ signal.

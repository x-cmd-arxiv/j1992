In this paper we extend Rokhlin,\nKharlamov-Gudkov-Krakhnov and Kharlamov-Marin congruences for curves on\nsurfaces and give some applications of this extension.\n  For some pairs consisting of a surface and a curve on this surface (in\nparticular for M-pairs) we introduce a new structure --- the complex separation\nthat is separation of the complement of curve into two surfaces. In accordance\nwith Rokhlin terminology the complex separation is a complex topological\ncharacteristic of real algebraic varieties. The complex separation is similar\nto complex orientations introduced by O.Ya.Viro (to the absolute complex\norientation in the case when a curve is empty and to the relative complex\norientation otherwise). In some cases we calculate the complex separation of a\nsurface (for example in the case when surface is the double branched covering\nof another surface along a curve). With the help of these calculations\napplications of the extension of Rokhlin congruence gives some new restrictions\nfor complex orientations of curves on a hyperboloid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 1992 22:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

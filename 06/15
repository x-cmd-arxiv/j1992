In particular, these decay modes can yield\nvaluable information on the amount of $Z_1-Z_2$ mixing, on the generation\ndependence of the \\ztwo\\ couplings, on the properties of the new generator\nassociated with the \\ztwo, as well as being used to distinguish between\npossible extended models. The analogous 3-body decays into a new, heavy charged\ngauge boson, $\\ztwo\\to W_2^\\pm\\ell^\\mp\\nu$, are also investigated in models\nwhere this can occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 1992 12:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 1992 17:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

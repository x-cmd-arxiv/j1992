The number of fermion flavors is chosen large $(N_f=12)$\nto compare with analytic results. A first order chiral symmetry restoring\ntransition is found at zero temperature with a critical chemical potential\n$\\mu_c$ in good agreement with the large $N_f$ calculations. The critical index\n$\\nu$ of the correlation length is measured in good agreement with analytic\ncalculations. The two dimensional phase diagram (chemical potential vs.\ntemperature) is mapped out quantitatively. Finite size effects on relatively\nsmall lattices and non-zero fermion mass effects are seen to smooth out the\nchiral transition dramatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 1992 12:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

For the Higgs boson mass smaller than the masses of W and Z bosons,\nthe phase transition is of the first order. However, its strength is\napproximately 2/3 times less than what follows from the one-loop approximation.\nThis rules out baryogenesis in the minimal version of the electroweak theory\nwith light Higgs bosons. The possibility of the strongly first order phase\ntransition in the theory with superheavy Higgs bosons is considered.\n  We show that if the Yang-Mills field at high temperature acquires a magnetic\nmass $\\sim g^2 T$, then no linear terms appear in the effective potential in\nall orders of perturbation theory and the symmetry in gauge theories at high\ntemperatures is actually restored. Even though the last statement was never\nquestioned by most of the authors, it was extremely difficult to come to a\nreliable conclusion about it due to the infrared problem in thermodynamics of\nnon-Abelian gauge fields.\n  The phase transition occurs due to production and expansion of critical\nbubbles. A general analytic expression for the probability of the bubble\nformation is obtained, which may be used for study of tunneling in a wide class\nof theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 1992 02:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

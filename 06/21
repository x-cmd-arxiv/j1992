The chiral ground rings at these points are shown to define the A-D-E\nseries of singular varieties introduced by Klein. The non-chiral ground rings\nrelevant to closed-string theory are 3 real dimensional singular varieties\nobtained as U(1) quotients of the Kleinian varieties. The unbroken symmetries\nof the theory at these points are the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of\nthese varieties. The theory of Kleinian singularities has a close relation to\nthat of complex hyperKahler surfaces, or gravitational instantons. We speculate\non the relevance of these instantons and of self-dual gravity in c=1 string\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 1992 11:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

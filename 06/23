Instead, it has been proposed that\nthroughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken\nphases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the\ncase. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous\nstate of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.\n  In addition, an analytic treatment of the one Higgs doublet, electroweak\nphase transition in the standard model and minimal extensions is reviewed.\nResults from the thin wall approximation are compared to results obtained using\nthe Lindes' action. Perhaps the most important quantitative result we can get\nfrom an analysis of the phase transition is determination of $\\vevphi$ when the\nphase transition completes. For Higgs boson masses above the current\nexperimental limit, the thin wall approximation determines the value of\n$\\vevphi$ at the end of the phase transition to an accuracy of better than\nthree percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 1992 15:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

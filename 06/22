Braaten and Pisarski\nhave used the Ward identities satisfied by the hard corrections to the n-point\nfunctions to argue the gauge fixing independence of the leading order resummed\nQCD plasma damping rate in covariant and strict Coulomb gauges. We extend their\nanalysis to include all linear gauges that preserve rotational invariance and\ndisplay explicitly the conditions required for gauge fixing independence. It is\nshown that in covariant gauges the resummed damping constant is gauge fixing\nindependent only if an infrared regulator is explicitly maintained throughout\nthe calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 1992 18:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

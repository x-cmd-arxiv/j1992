In\n\\cite{shokurov:hyp} it was conjectured that many of the interesting sets,\nassociated with these varieties have something in common: they satisfy the\nascending chain condition, which means that every increasing chain of elements\nterminates. Philosophically, this is the reason why two main hypotheses in the\nMinimal Model Program: existence and termination of flips should be true and\nare possible to prove.\n  In this paper we prove that the following two sets satisfy the ascending\nchain condition:\n  1. The set of minimal log discrepancies for $K_X+B$ where $X$ is a surface\nwith log canonical singularities.\n  2. The set of groups $(b_1,...b_s)$ such that there is a surface $X$ with log\ncanonical and numerically trivial $K_X+\\sum b_jB_j$. The order on such groups\nis defined in a natural way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 1992 20:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

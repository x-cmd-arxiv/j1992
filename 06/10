The system also possesses a hidden\nconformal invariance and then the full group of symmetries is the {\\it extended\nsuperconformal Galilean} group. We also show that imposing extended\nsuperconformal Galilean symmetry determines the values of the coupling\nconstants in such a way that their values in the bosonic sector agree with the\nvalues of Jackiw and Pi for which self-dual equation exist. We finally analyze\nthe second quantized version of the model and the two-particle sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 1992 17:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

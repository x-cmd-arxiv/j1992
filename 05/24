Evidence is found for a chirally related transition at\nnon-zero quark mass in the intermediate coupling region for $\\beta < 5.2 $ but\nsuperimposed upon a smooth behaviour for the condensate.

The\nstep which involves calculating tetrahedra by solving certain non- linear\nequations is repaired by introducing additional linear equations. As a first\nstep towards a new algorithm for general graphs we find useful linear equations\nfor those special graphs which support knots and links. Using the improved set\nof equations for tetrahedra we examine the symmetries between tetrahedra\ngenerated by arbitrary simple currents. Along the way we uncover the classical\norigin of simple-current charges. The improved skein relations also lead to\nexact identities between planar tetrahedra in level $K$ $G(N)$ and level $N$\n$G(K)$ CS theories, where $G(N)$ denotes a classical group. These results are\nrecast as identities for quantum $6j$-symbols and WZW braid matrices. We obtain\nthe transformation properties of arbitrary graphs and links under simple\ncurrent symmetries and rank-level duality. For links with knotted components\nthis requires precise control of the braid eigenvalue permutation signs, which\nwe obtain from plethysm and an explicit expression for the (multiplicity free)\nsigns, valid for all compact gauge groups and all fusion products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 1992 03:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In a certain kinematical limit rather reliable estimates are\npossible. It is demonstrated that the nonfactorizable parts are of the same\norder as the factorizable $1/N_c$ parts of the ampiltudes, and have the\nopposite sign. Thus, an approximate rule of discarding $1/N_c$ corrections in\nthe nonleptonic exclusive decays emerges dynamically. It is shown that this\nrule is not exact and the degree of compensation is different in different\nchannels.\n  Our predictions make use of the fact that a key matrix element that measures\ndeviations from factorization can be determined using the heavy quark effective\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1992 01:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

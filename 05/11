In general, particle masses will have different\ndilaton couplings. We can always choose a conformal frame in which baryons have\nconstant masses while (non--baryonic) dark matter have variable masses, in the\ncontext of a scalar--tensor gravity theory. We are interested in the\nphenomenology of this scenario. Dark matter with variable masses could have a\nmeasurable effect on the dynamical motion of the halo of spiral galaxies, which\nmay affect cold dark matter models of galaxy formation. As a consequence of\nvariable masses, the energy--momentum tensor is not conserved; there is a\ndissipative effect, due to the dilaton coupling, associated with a ``dark\nentropy\" production. In particular, if axions had variable masses they could be\ndiluted away, thus opening the ``axion window\". Assuming that dark matter with\nvariable masses dominates the cosmological evolution during the matter era, it\nwill affect the primordial nucleosynthesis predictions on the abundances of\nlight elements. Furthermore, the dilaton also couples to radiation in the form\nof a variable gauge coupling. Experimental bounds will constrain the parameters\nof this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1992 10:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

A global horizontal symmetry $U(1)_H$ is\nimposed, which on spontaneous breaking gives rise to a Goldstone boson. This\nsymmetry is chosen in a way that makes a) the contribution of heavy ($\\leq$\n  MeV) majorana neutrinos to the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude\nvanish and b) allows the heavy neutrino to decay to a lighter neutrino and the\nGoldstone boson.

Possibility of describing\nthe 17 keV neutrino in this minimal seesaw model is investigated. While most of\nthe cosmological and astrophysical constraints on the 17 keV neutrino can be\nsatisfied in this model, the laboratory limits coming from the neutrino\noscillations cannot be easily met.

The corresponding bounds in case of\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes are known to coincide with\nthe requirement that naked singularities be absent. Here we investigate charged\ndilaton black holes in this context. We show that the extreme solutions\nsaturate the supersymmetry bound of $N=4\\ d=4$ supergravity, or dimensionally\nreduced superstring theory. Specifically, we have shown that extreme dilaton\nblack holes, with electric and magnetic charges, admit super-covariantly\nconstant spinors. The supersymmetric positivity bound for dilaton black holes,\n$M \\geq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}(|Q|+|P|)$, takes care of the absence of naked\nsingularities of the dilaton black holes and is, in this sense, equivalent to\nthe cosmic censorship condition. The temperature, entropy and singularity are\ndiscussed. The Euclidean action (entropy) of the extreme black hole is given by\n$2\\pi |PQ|$. We argue that this result, as well as the one for Lorentzian\nsignature, is not altered by higher order corrections in the supersymmetric\ntheory. When a black hole reaches its extreme limit, it cannot continue to\nevaporate by emitting elementary particles, since this would violate the\nsupersymmetric positivity bound. We speculate on the possibility that an\nextreme black hole may ``evaporate\" by emitting smaller extreme black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 1992 00:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

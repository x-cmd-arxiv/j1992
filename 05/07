Hence, a single such nontrivial embedding $j$ generates an algebra of\nembeddings via these two operations, which satisfies certain laws (for example,\napplication distributes over both composition and application). Laver has\nshown, among other things, that this algebra is free on one generator with\nrespect to these laws.\n  The set of critical points of members of this algebra is the subject of this\npaper. This set contains the critical point $\\kappa_0$ of $j$, as well as all\nof the other ordinals $\\kappa_n$ in the critical sequence of $j$ (defined by\n$\\kappa_{n+1} = j(\\kappa_n)$). But the set includes many other ordinals as\nwell. The main result of this paper is that the number of critical points below\n$\\kappa_n$ (which has been shown to be finite by Laver and Steel) grows so\nquickly with $n$ that it dominates any primitive recursive function. In fact,\nit grows faster than the Ackermann function, and even faster than a slow\niterate of the Ackermann function. Further results show that, even just below\n$\\kappa_4$, one can find so many critical points that the number is only\nexpressible using fast-growing hierarchies of iterated functions (six levels of\niteration beyond exponentials).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 1992 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

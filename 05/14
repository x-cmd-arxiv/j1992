The simplest case is the 2d black hole. In\nhigher dimensions these geometries describe new and much more complex\nsingularities. For string and particle theories (defined in the text) we\nintroduce general methods for identifying global coordinates and give the\ngeneral exact solution for the geodesics for any gauged WZW model for any\nnumber of dimensions. We then specialize to the 3d geometries associated with\n$SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ (and also $SO(3,1)/SO(2,1)$) and discuss in detail the global\nspace, geodesics, curvature singularities and duality properties of this space.\nThe large-small (or mirror) type duality property is reformulated as an\ninversion in group parameter space. The 3d global space has two topologically\ndistinct sectors, with patches of different sectors related by duality. The\nfirst sector has a singularity surface with the topology of ``pinched double\ntrousers\". It can be pictured as the world sheet of two closed strings that\njoin into a single closed string and then split into two closed strings, but\nwith a pinch in each leg of the trousers. The second sector has a singularity\nsurface with the topology of ``double saddle\", pictured as the world sheets of\ntwo infinite open strings that come close but do not touch. We discuss the\ngeodesicaly complete spaces on each side of these surfaces and interpret the\nmotion of particles in physical terms. A cosmological interpretation is\nsuggested and comments are mode on possible physical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 1992 20:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

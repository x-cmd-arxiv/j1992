The effective theory has a fairly low ultraviolet cutoff. As a\nresult, loop corrections are small, at least if the effective action contains a\nterm which is quadratic in the fields, and physical predictions can be read\nstraight from the effective Lagrangean.\n  Methods will be discussed how to compute an effective low energy action from\na given fundamental action, either analytically or numerically, or by a\ncombination of both methods. Basically,the idea is to integrate out the high\nfrequency components of fields. This requires the choice of a \"blockspin\",i.e.\nthe specification of a low frequency field as a function of the fundamental\nfields. These blockspins will be the fields of the effective field theory. The\nblockspin need not be a field of the same type as one of the fundamental\nfields, and it may be composite. Special features of blockspins in nonabelian\ngauge theories will be discussed in some detail.\n  In analytical work and in multigrid updating schemes one needs interpolation\nkernels $\\A$ from coarse to fine grid in addition to the averaging kernels $C$\nwhich determines the blockspin. A neural net strategy for finding optimal\nkernels is presented.\n  Numerical methods are applicable to obtain actions of effective theories on\nlattices of finite volume. The constraint effective potential) is of particular\ninterest. In a Higgs model it yields the free energy, considered as a function\nof a gauge covariant magnetization. Its shape determines the phase structure of\nthe theory. Its loop expansion with and without gauge fields can be used to\ndetermine finite size corrections to numerical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 1992 16:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

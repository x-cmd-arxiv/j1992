It is shown\nthat the model is finite to all orders of the loop expansion if the dependence\nof the ``transverse\" part of the metric $\\ggij (u,x)$ on the light cone\ncoordinate $u$ is subject to the standard renormalization group equation of the\n$N$ - dimensional sigma model, $ {d\\ggij\\over du} = \\gb_{ij} =R_{ij} + ... $.\nIn particular, we discuss the `one - coupling' case when $\\ggij(u,x)$ is a\nmetric of an $N$ - dimensional symmetric space $\\gij(x)$ multiplied by a\nfunction $f(u)$. The theory is finite if $f(u)$ is equal to the ``running\"\ncoupling of the symmetric space sigma model (with $u$ playing the role of the\nRG ``time\"). For example, the geometry of space - time with $\\gij$ being the\nmetric of the $N$ - sphere is determined by the form of the $\\gb$ - function of\nthe $O(N+1)$ model. The ``asymptotic freedom\" limit of large $u$ corresponds to\nthe weak coupling limit of small $2+N$ - dimensional curvature. We prove that\nthere exists a dilaton field which together with the $2+N$ - dimensional metric\nsolves the sigma model Weyl invariance conditions. The resulting backgrounds\nthus represent new tree level string vacua. We also remark on possible\nconnections with some $2d$ quantum gravity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 1992 14:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 1992 01:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

The first\none is bound by stringy cosmic strings. The scale of such domain walls is\ngoverned by the scale of gaugino condensation (${\\cal O} (10^{16}$ GeV) in the\ncase of hidden $E_8$ gauge group), while the separation between minima is of\norder $M_{pl}$. We discuss the formation of walls and their cosmological\nimplications: the walls must be gotten rid of, either by chopping by stringy\ncosmic strings and/or inflation. Since there is no usual Kibble mechanism to\ncreate strings, either one must assume they exist $ab initio$, or one must\nconclude that string cosmologies require inflation.

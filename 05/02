We obtain an expression for the time delay due to\nsuch nonstationary lenses; the advantage over previous papers is that Perlick's\nformulation of the Fermat principle is very rigorous and more suitable for\npractical calculations in some cases. It is also shown that ordinary moving\ngravitational lenses must be considered as a stationary case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 1992 16:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is\ngreatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5\nradian per scale height.

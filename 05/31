It is no doubt also\nrecognized that in a somewhat similar way, the 4d $BF$ interaction (with $B$ a\ntwo form, $dB$ the dual $^*j$ of the eletromagnetic current, and F the\nelectromagnetic field form) describes the scaling limit of a superconductor. We\nshow in this paper that there are edge excitations in this model as well for\nmanifolds with boundaries. They are the modes of a scalar field with invariance\nunder the group of diffeomorphisms (diffeos) of the bounding spatial\ntwo-manifold. Not all of this group seem implementable by operators in quantum\ntheory, the implementable group being a subgroup of volume preserving diffeos.\nThe $BF$ system in this manner can lead to the $w_{1+\\infty }$ algebra and its\nvariants. Lagrangians for fields on the bounding manifold which account for the\nedge observables on quantization are also presented. They are the analogues of\nthe $1+1$ dimentional massless scalar field Lagrangian describing the edge\nmodes of an abelian Chern-Simons theory with a disk as the spatial manifold. We\nargue that the addition of ``Maxwell'' terms constructed from $F\\wedge ^*F$ and\n$dB\\wedge ^*dB$ do not affect the edge states, and that the augmented\nLagrangian has an infinite number of conserved charges- the aforementioned\nscalar field modes- localized at the edges. This Lagrangian is known to\ndescribe London equations and a massive vector field. A $(3+1)$ dimensional\ngeneralization of the Hall effect involving vortices coupled to $B$ is also\nproposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 1992 22:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The bosonization of the $\\bZ_4$\nparafermion theory and the generalized commutation relations satisfied by the\nmodes of various parafermion fields are reviewed. In this preliminary analysis,\nwe describe a Fock space which is simply a tensor product of $\\bZ_4$\nparafermion and free boson Fock spaces. It is larger than the Lorentz-covariant\nFock space indicated by the fractional superstring partition function. We\nderive the form of the fractional superconformal algebra that may be used as\nthe constraint algebra for the physical states of the FSS. Issues concerning\nthe associativity, modings and braiding properties of the fractional\nsuperconformal algebra are also discussed. The use of the constraint algebra to\nobtain physical state conditions on the spectrum is illustrated by an\napplication to the massless fermions and bosons of the $K=4$ fractional\nsuperstring. However, we fail to generalize these considerations to the massive\nstates. This means that the appropriate constraint algebra on the fractional\nsuperstring Fock space remains to be found. Some possible ways of doing this\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 1992 22:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

For the case of a short range\ninteraction, $V(z)$, between the particle and the surface atom supporting a\nbound state, an explicit non-perturbative solution of the collision problem is\npresented. For finite and large $N$, there is no true sticking but only\nso-called Feshbach resonances. A finite sticking coefficient ${\\sl s}(E)$ is\nobtained by introducing a small phonon decay rate $\\eta$ and letting\n$N\\to\\infty$. Our main interest is in the behavior of ${\\sl s}(E)$ as $E\\to 0$.\nFor a short range $V(z)$, we find ${\\sl s}(E)\\sim E^{1/2}$, regardless of the\nstrength of the particle-phonon coupling. However, if $V(z)$ has a Coulomb\n$z^{-1}$ tail, we find ${\\sl s}(E)\\to\\alpha$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$. [A fully\nclassical calculation gives ${\\sl s}(E)\\to 1$ in both cases.] We conclude that\nthe same threshold laws apply to 3D systems of neutral and charged particles\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 1992 20:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The effective action is written as a\none-dimensional path integral, which can be calculated to any order in the\ngauge coupling; evaluation leads to Feynman parameter integrals directly,\nbypassing the usual algebra required from Feynman diagrams, and leading to\ncompact and organized expressions. This formalism is valid off-shell, is\nexplicitly gauge invariant, and can be extended to a number of other field\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 1992 18:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

We focus our study on a class of\n$N=2$ non-linear sigma models in $d=2+1$ based on an arbitrary K\\\"ahler target\nmanifold and their associated soliton or ``lump\" solutions. Using a collective\nco-ordinate expansion, we construct an effective action which, upon\nquantisation, describes the low-energy dynamics of the lumps. The effective\naction is an $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics action with the target\nmanifold being the moduli space of static charge $N$ lump solutions of the\nsigma model. The Hilbert space of states of the effective theory consists of\nanti-holomorphic forms on the moduli space. The normalisable elements of the\ndolbeault cohomology classes $H^{(0,p)}$ of the moduli space correspond to zero\nenergy bound states and we argue that such states correpond to bound states in\nthe full quantum field theory of the sigma model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 1992 21:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

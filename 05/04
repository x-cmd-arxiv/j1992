The integral\nrepresentations of the Schroedinger equations are transformed into two\nequations whose solution has the form $\\psi_a(x) t(x,y) \\psi_b(y)$, where\n$\\psi_a$ and $\\psi_b$ are the wavefunctions for the two related systems and\n$t(x,y)$ is a kernel chosen to couple $x$ and $y$. The Monte Carlo process,\nwith random walkers on the enlarged configuration space $x \\otimes y$, solves\nthese equations by generating densities whose asymptotic form is the above\nbilinear distribution. With such a distribution, exact Monte Carlo estimators\ncan be obtained for the expectation values of quantum operators and for energy\ndifferences. We present results of these methods applied to several test\nproblems, including a model integral equation, and the hydrogen atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 1992 17:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-12"}

The renormalized Yukawa\ncoupling $y_R$ achieves here its maximal value and this $y$-region is thus of\nparticular importance for lattice investigations of strong Yukawa interaction.\nHowever, here the scalar field propagators have a very complex structure caused\nby fermion loop corrections and by the proximity of phases with\nantiferromagnetic properties. We develop methods for analyzing these\npropagators and for extracting the physical observables. We find that going\ninto the negative $\\kp$ region, the scalar field renormalization constant\nbecomes small and $y_R$ does not seem to exceed the unitarity bound, making the\nexistence of a nontrivial fixed point in the investigated Yukawa model quite\nunlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 1992 16:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

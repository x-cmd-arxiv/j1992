The main\ntool which is used, is the matrix model. Introductions to both the Liouville\nmodel and its matrix model formulation are included. In particular the special\nstates are discussed. Some calculations of partition functions on genus one\nusing field theory techniques are given. Nonperturbative issues and string\ntheory at finite radius are discussed. Zero momentum correlation functions are\ncalculated using the matrix model. One important result is a set of recursion\nrelations. The treatment is extended to nonzero momentum. The main result is a\nclear identification of the special states. Some comments on the Wheeler de\nWitt equation is given. The matrix model $W_{\\infty}$ algebra is introduced.\nThis organizes the previous results. In particular, a simple derivation of the\ngenus zero tachyon correlation functions is given. The results are then\nextended to higher genus. It is seen how a deformation of the algebra is\nresponsible for much of the higher genus structure. Some very explicit formulae\nare derived. Then the Liouville and matrix model calculations are compared\nfollowed by some general conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 1992 22:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this note we are\nconcerned with the orbits of this action of PGL(2) on P^d. The closure of each\norbit is a projective subvariety of P^d of which we determine the degree, the\n`boundary'--i.e., the complement of an orbit in its closure--, and the\nmultiplicity at points of the boundary. These results are used to provide a\ncomplete classification of the non-singular orbit closures, and criteria for an\norbit closure to be non-singular in codimension 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 1992 15:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

This\nresults from the constraints that need to be introduced in the Feynman path\nintegral to take into account the non-independent scalar degrees of freedom,\nand from the breaking of the symmetry by the non-vanishing vacuum expectation\nvalue of the Higgs boson. Unitarity and gauge invariance are achieved; the\nformer can be made explicit by \"gauging\" the Wess-Zumino field into the third\ncomponent of the massive gauge boson; the latter is recovered at the level of\nGreen functions through the cancellation of the non-invariance of the action\nwith that of the fermionic measure. The compensation of the anomaly can also be\nseen as a consequence of the infinite mass of the fermions. The pseudoscalar\npartner of the Higgs is shown to behave like an abelian pion, specially as far\nare its leptonic decays are concerned; in particular, no extra scale of\ninteraction is needed, unlike in \"technicolour\" theories. The correct decay of\nthe pion into two photons is recovered despite the abscence of anomaly.\nArguments are given in favour of renormalizability. The leptonic sector is the\nobject of a subsequent work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 1992 08:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 1993 08:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 1993 11:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

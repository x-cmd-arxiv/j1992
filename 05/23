A consistent continuum limit of the model exists only if the\nrenormalized scale constant $\\beta_R$ vanishes for some value of the bare scale\nconstant~$\\beta$. The geodesic action has a special form that allows direct\naccess to the small-$\\beta$ limit. In this limit half of the degrees of freedom\ncan be integrated out exactly. The remaining degrees of freedom are those of a\ncompact model having a $\\beta$-independent action which is noteworthy in being\nunbounded from below yet yielding integrable averages. Both the exact action\nand the $\\beta$-independent action are used to obtain $\\beta_R$ from Monte\nCarlo computations of field-field averages (2-point functions) and\ncurrent-current averages. Many consistency cross-checks are performed. It is\nfound that there is no value of $\\beta$ for which $\\beta_R$ vanishes. This\nmeans that as the lattice cutoff is removed the theory becomes that of a pair\nof massless free fields. Because these fields have neither the geometry nor the\nsymmetries of the original model we conclude that the $O(1,2)/O(2)\\times Z_2$\nmodel has no continuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 1992 16:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

It is found that the intertwining of two super-Hamiltonians is\nequivalent to there being a canonical transformation between them. A\nconsequence is that the procedure for solving a differential equation can be\nviewed as a sequence of elementary canonical transformations trivializing the\nsuper-Hamiltonian associated to the equation.

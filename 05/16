Classically, the theory has some exact solutions. These\ninclude configurations representing black holes. A semi-classical theory is\nobtained by assuming that these singular solutions are caused by the collapse\nof some matter fields. The semi-classical equations of motion reveal then that\nany generic solution must have a flat geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1992 16:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

It is therefore a good model for testing nonperturbative methods that\nmay be useful in quantum gravity, especially methods based on lattice field\ntheory. In this paper we develop the theoretical framework necessary for\nrecognizing and studying a consistent nonperturbative quantum field theory of\nthe $O(1,2)/O(2)\\times Z_2$ model. We describe the action, the geometry of the\nconfiguration space, the conserved Noether currents, and the current algebra,\nand we construct a version of the Ward-Slavnov identity that makes it easy to\nswitch from a given field to a nonlinearly related one. Renormalization of the\nmodel is defined via the effective action and via current algebra. The two\ndefinitions are shown to be equivalent. In a companion paper we develop a\nlattice formulation of the theory that is particularly well suited to the sigma\nmodel, and we report the results of Monte Carlo simulations of this lattice\nmodel. These simulations indicate that as the lattice cutoff is removed the\ntheory becomes that of a pair of massless free fields. Because the geometry and\nsymmetries of these fields differ from those of the original model we conclude\nthat a continuum limit of the $O(1,2)/O(2)\\times Z_2$ model which preserves\nthese properties does not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 1992 01:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

We review the\nargument that in a generic supergravity theory in which supersymmetry is {\\it\ndynamically} broken in the hidden sector, only tiny Majorana masses for\ngauginos are generated. This situation is similar to that of theories with\ncontinuous R-symmetries, for which Hall and Randall have suggested that gluino\nmasses could arise through mixings with an octet of chiral fields. We note that\nin hidden sector models, such mixing can only occur if the auxiliary D field of\na $U(1)$ gauge field has an expectation value. This in turn gives rise to a\ncatastrophically large Fayet-Iliopoulos term for ordinary hypercharge. To solve\nthis problem it is necessary to unify hypercharge at least partially in a\nnon-Abelian group. We consider, also, some general issues in models with\ncontinuous or discrete R symmetries, noting that it may be necessary to include\n$SU(2)$ triplet fields, and that these are subject to various constraints. In\nthe course of these discussions, we consider a number of naturalness problems.\nWe suggest that the so-called ``$\\mu$-problem\" is not a problem, and point out\nthat in models in which the axion decay constant is directly related to the\nSUSY breaking scale, squarks, sleptons and Higgs particles generically acquire\nhuge masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 1992 21:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

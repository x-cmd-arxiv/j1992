Indeed, the\nFourier coefficients of the vector field in (1) turn out to be essentially the\nsame as (the first variations of) the corresponding power series coefficients\nin (2). These identities have many applications; in particular, to conformal\nwelding, to the almost complex structure of Teichm\\\"uller space, to study of\nthe Weil-Petersson metric, to variational formulas for period matrices, etc.\nThese utilities are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 1992 11:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We demonstrate that this trivial reparameterisation invariance has\nnon-trivial consequences: it relates coefficients of terms of different orders\nin the $1/m$ expansion and requires linear combinations of these operators to\nbe multiplicatively renormalised. For example, the operator $-D^2/2m$ in the\neffective lagrangian has zero anomalous dimension, coefficient one, and does\nnot receive any non-perturbative contributions from matching conditions. We\nalso demonstrate that this invariance severely restricts the forms of operators\nwhich may appear in chiral lagrangians for heavy particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 1992 18:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

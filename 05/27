The calculations of the undoped\nsystems agree well with the known results. When the system (C_{60} or C_{70})\nis doped with one or two electrons (or holes), the additional charges\naccumulate almost along an equatorial line of the molecule. The dimerization\nbecomes weaker almost along the same line. Two energy levels intrude largely in\nthe gap. The intrusion is larger in C_{70} than in C_{60}. Therefore,\n``polarons'' are predicted in doped buckminster- fullerenes. We calculate\noptical absorption coefficient for C_{60} in order to look at how ``polarons''\nwill be observed. It is predicted that there appears a new peak at the lower\nenergy than the intergap transition peaks.

These were done both in the microcanonical ensemble, with the\nnumber of points in the triangulation and the number of Ising spins fixed, and\nin the grand canoncal ensemble. We have investigated the two possible cases of\nthe spins living on the vertices of the triangulation (``diect'' case) and the\nspins living in the middle of the tetrahedra (``dual'' case). We observed phase\ntransitions which are probably second order, and found that the dual\nimplementation more effectively couples the spins to the quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 1992 18:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are\nexplored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which\ntreat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux\ndilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical\nwhen their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type\nII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\nintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\n10\\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\nsupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\n1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\nrange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\nthe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\nand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\nCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\nlarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\nfluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\nmethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\na value of $H_0 = 60 \\pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to\nerrors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved\nby applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II\nsupernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 1992 19:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\nradiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth\ndepends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical\ndivergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth\nthe high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly\nuniversal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a\ngamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit\nfor the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed.

We consider a\ngeneral $\\pbyo$ reconstruction, in the presence of inter--step interactions and\nclosed islands. Our analysis predicts the existence of a new type of rough\nphase, with incommensurate correlations in the reconstruction order parameter\nand unusual momentum space singularities at a characteristic ``Fermi momentum''\nand its harmonics, analagous to the Luttinger liquid of one--dimensional\nFermions. The general phase structure for $p>1$ is as follows: for $p>2$, there\nis a flat ordered (FO), a rough incommensurate (RI), and a flat incommensurate\nphase (FI). The FO--RI and FO--FI transitions are of the commensurate to\nincommensurate type, and the FI--RI transition is in the Kosterlitz--Thouless\n(KT) universality class. For $p=2$, the FI phase is replaced by a flat\ndisordered phase (FD), and there may be a new rough disordered phase (RD).

Recently it was solved for the impenetrable Bose Gas. The idea is\nto represent correlation function as $\\tau$ function of calssical completely\nintegrable differential equation. Now we start to apply this program to\nisotropic XY model in the trasnsverse magnetic field. In this paper we are\nmaking first step.
